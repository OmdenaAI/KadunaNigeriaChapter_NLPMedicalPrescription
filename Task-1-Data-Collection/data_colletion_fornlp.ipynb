      "Disease: Anthrax\n",
      "Description: Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. The spores of the bacteria can survive in the environment for years or decades, awaiting uptake by the next host. The disease still exists in animals and humans in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, in several southern European countries, in the Americas, and certain areas of Australia. There are four types of Anthrax; Cutaneous Anthrax, Inhalation Anthrax, Gastrointestinal Anthrax and Injection Anthrax.\n",
      "Symptoms: The symptoms of anthrax depend on the type of infection and can take anywhere from one day to more than two months to appear. Cutaneous Anthrax include a group of small blisters or bumps that may itch, swelling can occur around the sore, A painless skin sore (ulcer) with a black center that appears after the small blisters or bumps and most often the sore will be on the face, neck, arms, or hands. Inhalation Anthrax involve fever and chills, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, confusion or dizziness and cough, nausea, vomiting, or stomach pains, headache, sweats (often drenching), extreme tiredness and body aches. Gastrointestinal Anthrax symptoms involve fever and chills, swelling of neck or neck glands, sore throat, painful swallowing, hoarseness, nausea and vomiting, especially bloody vomiting, diarrhoea or bloody diarrhoea, headache, flushing (red face) and red eyes, stomach pain, fainting and swelling of abdomen (stomach). Injection Anthrax include fever and chills, a group of small blisters or bumps that may itch, appearing where the drug was injected, a painless skin sore with a black center that appears after the blisters or bumps, swelling around the sore and abscesses deep under the skin or in the muscle where the drug was injected.\n",
      "Treatment: All Type of Anthrax can be treated by Antibiotics and Antitoxin. Antibiotics can also prevent anthrax from developing in people who have been exposed but have not developed symptoms. Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline are two of the antibiotics that could be used to prevent anthrax.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Avian Influenza\n",
      "Description: Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. Three subtypes of avian influenza A viruses are known to infect people (H5, H7 and H9 viruses). Among these, Asian lineage H5N1 and H7N9 have caused the majority of infections in people. Extensive outbreaks in poultry have occurred in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East since 1997, but only sporadic human infections have occurred to date.\n",
      "Symptoms: Common initial symptoms of the A(H5) and A(H7N9) avian influenza viruses are high fever and cough followed by dyspnea or difficulty breathing. Abdominal pain, bleeding from the nose or gums, diarrhea, vomiting, encephalitis, and chest pain have also been reported. For A(H7N7) and A(H9N2), disease is typically mild.\n",
      "Treatment: Treatment of avian influenza is recommended for at least 5 days. As soon as possible, neuraminidase inhibitors should be prescribed, though they can be administered at various stages of illness. Corticosteroids should not be used routinely unless necessary.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Chikungunya\n",
      "Description: Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It was first introduced during an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1952. The symptoms include abrupt onset of fever accompanied by muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, rash, and severe joint pain. Sometimes the symptoms are mild, and the infection go unrecognized or misdiagnosed as dengue fever.\n",
      "Symptoms: Prevention and control are usually done by destroying or reducing natural and artificial mosquito breeding habitats, and by using insecticides to control mosquitoes. Using insecticide-treated mosquito nets and wearing clothing that minimizes exposure to mosquito bites can be helpful.\n",
      "Treatment: Not Available\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Cholera\n",
      "Description: Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection that can kill within hours, if left untreated. Cholera remains a global public health threat, causing between 1.3 million to 4.0 million cases, and 21,000 and 143,000 deaths worldwide every year. It is caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.\n",
      "Symptoms: Prevention and control can be achieved by consuming clean water and food, and by providing proper hygiene conditions and access to basic services. Adopting basic hygienic behaviours such as regular handwashing with soap after defecation and before handling food or eating, and safe preparation and conservation of food are essential. Vaccination with Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV) has proved effective in cholera control. The primary treatment for cholera is the use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and the use of antibiotics.\n",
      "Treatment: Not Available\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Covid 19\n",
      "Description: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a communicable respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that causes illness in humans. Scientists are still learning about the disease, and think that the virus began in animals. At some point, one or more humans acquired infection from an animal, and those infected humans began transmitting infection to other humans.\n",
      "Symptoms: Not Available\n",
      "Treatment: Not Available\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever\n",
      "Description: The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CCHF is endemic in Africa and has case fatality rate of 40%. The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons. There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.\n",
      "Symptoms: The incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus and it varies from 1 to a maximum of 13 days. Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, muscle pain, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and light sensitivity. There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable liver enlargement.\n",
      "Treatment: General supportive care with treatment of symptoms is the main approach to managing CCHF in people. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used to treat CCHF infection with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Dengue Fever\n",
      "Description: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection. The infection causes flu-like illness, and occasionally develops into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades. About half of the world’s population is now at risk. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates below 1%. Dengue prevention and control depends on effective vector control measures. A dengue vaccine has been licensed by several National Regulatory Authorities for use in people 9-45 years of age living in endemic settings.\n",
      "Symptoms: Dengue should be suspected when a high fever (40°C/104°F) is accompanied by 2 of the following symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rash. Symptoms usually last for 2-7 days, after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito. Severe dengue is a potentially deadly complication due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment.\n",
      "Treatment: There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. For severe dengue, medical care by physicians and nurses experienced with the effects and progression of the disease can save lives – decreasing mortality rates from more than 20% to less than 1%. Maintenance of the patient’s body fluid volume is critical to severe dengue care.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Ebola Virus Disease\n",
      "Description: Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe, often fatal, illness originally transmitted to humans from wild animals (such as fruit bats, porcupines and non-human primates) and then transmitted from human to human through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of an infected person. It can also be transmitted through surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids. The virus was first discovered in 1976 in the Ebola River region of Congo.\n",
      "Symptoms: There is currently no proven cure for Ebola but there are experimental vaccines that can protect against infection. Early diagnosis and treatment can help a patient recover. Clinical care includes rehydration with fluids and body salts and treatment of specific symptoms such as low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhoea and infections. Hand hygiene and a number of interventions can help control the spread, including surveillance, contact tracing, isolation of confirmed patients, laboratory testing, safe burials, and working with communities to reduce risk factors.\n",

      "Disease: Hepatitis B Virus Hbv\n",
      "Description: Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is a major global health problem. It can cause chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. The vaccine is 95% effective in preventing infection and the development of chronic disease and liver cancer due to hepatitis B. At the WHO African region 6.1% of the population is infected. In the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region (Which includes some of the north African Countries), 2% of the population is infected. HIV is an important occupational hazard for Health workers. However, it can be prevented through an effective and safe vaccine.\n",
      "Symptoms: In most cases, Hepatitis B is symptomless. In symptomatic cases, the patients might experience fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, stomach upset, vomiting, grey stool, dark urine, joint pain, yellow skin and eyes. In some cases, the hepatitis B virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer.\n",
      "Treatment: There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis B. Therefore, care is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with medicines, including oral antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. The best and easiest way to prevent Hepatitis B is by getting vaccinated. The Hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as a series of 3 shots over a period of 6 months. The entire series is needed for long-term protection.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Hepatitis C Virus\n",
      "Description: Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus: the virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis infection, ranging in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. A significant number of those who are chronically infected will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean region (Which includes some northern African countries) is the most affected region with prevalence of 2.3%. Depending on the country, hepatitis C virus infection can be concentrated in certain populations (for example, among people who inject drugs) and/or in general populations. There are multiple strains (or genotypes) of the HCV virus and their distribution varies by region.\n",
      "Symptoms: The incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, approximately 80% of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes).\n",
      "Treatment: There is currently no vaccine for HCV. However, Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from liver cancer and cirrhosis, but access to diagnosis and treatment is low. Hepatitis C does not always require treatment as the immune response in some people will clear the infection, and some people with chronic infection do not develop liver damage. When treatment is necessary, the goal of hepatitis C treatment is cure. The cure rate depends on several factors including the strain of the virus and the type of treatment given. Access to HCV treatment is improving but remains limited. In 2015, of the 71 million persons living with HCV infection globally, 20% (14 million) knew their diagnosis. 7.4% of those diagnosed (1.1 million) were started on treatment in 2015. In 2016, 1.76 million people were additionally treated in bringing the global coverage of hepatitis C curative treatment to 13%. Much needs to be done in order for the world to achieve the 80% treatment target by 2030.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Hepatitis E Virus\n",
      "Description: Hepatitis E is a liver infection caused by the virus HEV. Hepatitis E is common in regions with limited resources and limited access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation, hygiene, and health services. Every year there are 20 million HEV infections worldwide. China has produced and licensed the first vaccine to prevent hepatitis E virus infection, although it is not yet available globally.\n",
      "Symptoms: Typical symptoms include an initial fever, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, dark urine and pale stool, and a slightly enlarged and tender liver. Some people experience abdominal pain, itching without skin lesions, skin rash, or joint pain. In areas with high endemicity, symptoms are most often found in those 15-40 years old, and infection may go undiagnosed in asymptomatic children.\n",
      "Treatment: There is no specific treatment, but hospitalization is only required for those with fulminant hepatitis and is a consideration for pregnant women. Ribavarin, and antiviral drug, may be used for immunosuppressed people with chronic Hepatitis E.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Hiv Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n",
      "Description: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a major global public health challenge that does not have a cure till now. Globally, thirty-five million lives has been affected by this virus. The WHO African region is the most affected region with 25.7 million people living with HIV in 2017. The African region also accounts for over two thirds of the global total of new HIV infections. HIV affects the immune system and gradually undermines the body defense ability against other infections and cancers. This makes the body more prone to a wide spectrum of diseases than people with normal immune systems.\n",
      "Symptoms: The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. The first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash, or sore throat. As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi’s sarcoma.\n",
      "Treatment: Despite the fact that HIV does not have a cure, it can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a person’s body and allows an individual’s immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections. People can enjoy a healthy and productive life using this treatment. To reduce your risk of HIV infection, have a properly protected anal or vaginal sex. Don’t inject drugs. If you do, use only sterile injection equipment and water and never share your equipment with others.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Lassa Fever\n",
      "Description: Lassa Fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness that is endemic in some countries of West Africa. For example, Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. The overall case-fatality rate of Lassa Fever is 1%. The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100,000 to 300,000, with approximately 5,000 deaths. Unfortunately, such estimates are crude, because surveillance for cases of the disease is not uniformly performed. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10%-16% of people admitted to hospitals every year have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this region.\n",
      "Symptoms: The signs and symptoms of Lassa Fever is usually gradual. It starts with fever general weakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal pain may follow. In severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop. Deafness occurs in 25% of patients who survive the disease. In half of these cases, hearing returns partially after 1-3 months. Death usually occurs within 14 days of onset in fatal cases. About 80% of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no symptoms.\n",
      "Treatment: Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been used with success in Lassa fever patients. Patients should also receive early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment. Primary transmission of the Lassa virus from its host to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with Mastomys rodents, putting food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping the home clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Malaria\n",
      "Description: Malaria is transmitted to Humans through infected mosquito bites. Although Malaria is preventable and curable, it can be a life-threatening condition. In 2016, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries with 445,00 deaths, an increase of 5 million cases over 2015 with approximately similar number of deaths (446,000). In 2016, the WHO AFRO Region represented 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths\n",
      "Symptoms: The best available treatment, particularly for P. falciparum malaria, is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). RTS, S/AS01 (RTS, S) is the first and, to date, the only vaccine to show partial protection against malaria in young children. It acts against P. falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite globally and the most prevalent in Africa.Prevention and reduction of Malaria transmission can be done by vector control strategies which include insecticide-treated mosquito nets and indoor residual spraying.\n",
      "Treatment: Not Available\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Marburg Virus Disease Mvd\n",
      "Description: Marburg virus disease (MVD), formerly known as Marburg Hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. The Marburg virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through human-to-human transmission. It causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. The case-fatality rate for Marburg hemorrhagic fever is between 23 to 90%. Outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, and South Africa (in a person with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe).\n",
      "Symptoms: The symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Around the fifth day after the onset of symptoms, a maculopapular rash, most prominent on the trunk (chest, back, stomach), may occur. Nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may then appear. Symptoms become increasingly severe and can include jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multi-organ dysfunction.\n",
      "Treatment: There is no specific treatment for Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Early supportive care with rehydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralize the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Measles\n",
      "Description: Despite the fact that there is an effective vaccine for measles, Measles is still one of the leading causes of death among young children. Measles vaccination resulted in 84% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2016 worldwide.\n",
      "Symptoms: Measles incubation period ranges from 10-12 days. The signs and symptoms include high fever, runny nose, coughing, red and watery eyes, and probable small white spots inside the cheek. In few days, a rash erupts on the face and upper neck. In three days, the rash spreads to hands and feet. Then, in 5 to 6 days, the rash starts to fade. Serious complications are more common in children under the age of 5, or adults over the age of 30.\n",
      "Treatment: No specific antiviral treatment exists for Measles. Supportive care that ensures good nutrition, adequate fluid intake and treatment of dehydration is recommended. There is a cheap, effective and safe vaccine for measles. Routine vaccination for children and mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates, are key public health strategies to reduce global measles deaths.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Meningococcal Meningitis\n",
      "Description: Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial form of meningitis, a serious infection of the thin lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal meningitis is associated with high fatality (up to 50% when untreated). Meningococcal meningitis is observed worldwide but the highest burden of the disease is in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Around 30 000 cases are still reported each year from that area.\n",
      "Symptoms: The average incubation period is four days , but can range between two and ten days. The most common symptoms are a stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting. A less common but even more severe (often fatal) form of meningococcal disease is meningococcal septicemia, which is characterized by a hemorrhagic rash and rapid circulatory collapse.\n",
      "Treatment: Meningococcal disease is potentially fatal and should always be viewed as a medical emergency. Admission to a hospital or health center is necessary. Isolation of the patient is not necessary. Appropriate antibiotic treatment must be started as soon as possible. A range of antibiotics can treat the infection, including penicillin, ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Under epidemic conditions in Africa in areas with limited health infrastructure and resources, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\n",
      "Description: Coronaviruses are a large and diverse family of viruses that include viruses that are known to cause illness in humans (including the common cold) and animals. However, in 2012, the MERS (for “Middle East respiratory syndrome”) coronavirus (also known as MERS-CoV) was identified as a new type of coronavirus that could cause a rapid onset of severe respiratory disease in people. Many of the cases have occurred in people with underlying conditions that may make them more likely to get respiratory infections. All cases of human infection with MERS-CoV identified to date have been in people who lived in or travelled to the Middle East, or who have had close contact with people who acquired the infection in the Middle East.\n",
      "Symptoms: Typical symptoms present as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, symptoms can range from nonexistent to severe acute respiratory disease. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Diarrhea has been reported. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for MERS-CoV. Treatment is based on the condition and needs of the patient.\n",
      "Treatment: When visiting farms, markets, or barns where dromedary camels may be present, follow general hygiene procedures such as washing hands before and after touching animals and avoid contact with sick animals. Animal products, including camel meat and milk, should be properly handled with pasteurization, cooking or other heat treatments before consumption to avoid organisms carried in raw or undercooked meat.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Monkeypox\n",
      "Description: Key Facts:\n",
      "Symptoms: Distribution in AfricaAs of October 2022, monkeypox has been reported from 13 Africa Union (AU) Member States (MS): Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sudan, and South Africa. Prior to 2022, the following 11 countries have historically reported cases of monkeypox: Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Gabon, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and South Sudan.\n",
      "Treatment: Animal Reservoir HostAlthough the transmission cycle of monkeypox is not clearly understood nor has the primary reservoir host of the virus identified, the African rope squirrel (Funisciurus spp.), among other rodent species, is considered a potential reservoir host of the monkeypox virus in endemic regions in Africa.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Plague\n",
      "Description: Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacterium usually found in small mammals and their fleas. There are two main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or ‘buboes’. Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated. Currently, the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.\n",
      "Symptoms: People infected with plague usually develop acute febrile disease with other non-specific systemic symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, and weakness, vomiting and nausea.\n",
      "Treatment: Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed on time. Pneumonic plague can be fatal within 18 to 24 hours of disease onset if left untreated, but common antibiotics for enterobacteria (gram negative rods) can effectively cure the disease if they are delivered early.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Poliomyelitis Polio\n",
      "Description: Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. Polio mainly affects children under 5 years of age. Cases due to wild poliovirus have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350 000 cases then, to 22 reported cases in 2017. As a result of the global effort to eradicate the disease, more than 16 million people have been saved from paralysis.\n",
      "Symptoms: It invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. 1 in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis (usually in the legs). Among those paralyzed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.\n",
      "Treatment: There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented by vaccine. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Rift Valley Fever\n",
      "Description: Rift Valley Fever is transmitted to humans through contact with the blood or organs of infected animals, and through handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Humans can also be infected through consumption of unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals, or bites of infected mosquitoes and hematophagous flies.\n",
      "Symptoms: No specific treatment is required for patients with mild symptoms, while general supportive therapy is recommended for the more severe cases. Some vaccine candidates are under investigation and the only inactivated vaccine for RVF is neither licensed nor available commercially. Prevention can be achieved by avoiding close contact with infected animals and their body fluids and preventing mosquito bites.\n",
      "Treatment: Not Available\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Tuberculosis\n",
      "Description: Tuberculosis (TB) is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause from a single infectious agent. TB is also the leading killer of HIV-positive people. In 2016, 10.4 million people fell ill with TB. Quarter of those people are from Africa (2.5 million people). In the same year 1.7 million died from TB globally with 417,000 deaths (over 25 %) from the African region. Between 2000 and 2014, 10 million lives were saved in the African Region through TB diagnosis and treatment. Ending the TB epidemic by 2030 is among the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. The 2013 Abuja Declaration sets the targets of ending TB in Africa by 2030.\n",
      "Symptoms: TB has effective treatment and can be cured. The majority of cases can be cured when treatment is done properly. It is treated with a standard 6 months course of 4 antimicrobial drugs under the supervision of a health worker or a trained person. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most powerful, first-line anti-TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs. However, second-line treatment options are limited and require extensive chemotherapy (up to 2 years of treatment) with medicines that are expensive and toxic. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a more serious form of MDR-TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line anti-TB drugs, often leaving patients without any further treatment options. In August 14, 2019, the FDA approved a new drug for extensively drug – resistant TB.\n",
      "Treatment: There is a slightly effective vaccine for TB. It provides mild protection against the infection transmission. Stopping the transmission between adults is the first effective step of prevention. This is done by identifying patient s with active TB and cure them. Another aspect is identifying people with latent TB and prevent the development of the active infectious TB. Tuberculosis infection control through preventing the transmission in different settings such as hospitals is crucial step for prevention. The pasteurization of milk also helps to prevent humans from getting bovine TB.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Yellow Fever\n",
      "Description: Yellow Fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted through infected mosquitoes. It was named yellow as it, sometimes, cause jaundice (yellow skin and eyes) to the infected people. Thirty-four African countries are endemic to yellow fever.\n",
      "Symptoms: There is no specific antiviral drug for yellow fever. Survival rates can be improved by hospital based early supportive treatment. However, there is a single dose effective vaccine for yellow fever that provides life-long protection. Vaccination is recommended for people 9 month or over living or travelling to yellow fever endemic areas. Some countries require the yellow fever proof of vaccination to allow entry (see list below for African countries).\n",
      "Treatment: Countries that require vaccination for all travellers older that 9 months or 1 year:\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Disease: Zika Virus\n",
      "Description: Zika virus is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes during the day in tropical and subtropical regions. An increased risk of neurologic complications is associated with Zika virus infection in adults and children, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. From the 1960s to 1980s, rare sporadic cases of human infections were found across Africa and Asia, typically accompanied by mild illness.\n",
      "Symptoms: Most people infected with the Zika virus do not have symptoms. Occasionally mild symptoms occur, including rash, fever, headache, malaise, muscle and joint pain, and conjunctivitis. Risk of exposure is greatest in tropical and subtropical regions. Infected mosquitoes are most active during the day, especially in the early morning and late afternoon.\n",
      "Treatment: There is no available treatment. Those with symptoms should rest, drink fluids, and use common medicines to treat pain and fever. Pregnant women with the virus or living near areas of transmission should visit a doctor for laboratory testing.\n",

      "{'disease': 'Influenza (flu)', 'Overview': 'Flu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \"stomach flu\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn\\'t 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications. Aside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.', 'Symptoms': 'The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May. Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu. Other common flu symptoms include: In children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu. In some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.', 'Causes': \"Influenza is caused by viruses. These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. It's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often. A person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\", 'Diagnosis': None, 'Treatment': None}\n",

      "{'disease': 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Overview': \"Multiple sclerosis is a disease that causes breakdown of the protective covering of nerves. Multiple sclerosis can cause numbness, weakness, trouble walking, vision changes and other symptoms. It's also known as MS. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers, known as myelin. This interrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage of the nerve fibers. Symptoms of MS depend on the person, the location of damage in the nervous system and how bad the damage is to the nerve fibers. Some people lose the ability to walk on their own or move at all. Others may have long periods between attacks without any new symptoms, called remission. The course of the disease varies depending on the type of MS. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.\", 'Symptoms': \"Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary depending on the person. Symptoms may change over the course of the disease depending on which nerve fibers are affected. Common symptoms include: Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen symptoms of MS. These aren't considered true disease relapses but pseudorelapses.\", 'Causes': \"The cause of multiple sclerosis is not known. It's considered an immune-mediated disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks and destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This fatty substance is called myelin. Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages traveling along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked. It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors may increase the risk of MS.\", 'Diagnosis': None, 'Treatment': None}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Heart failure', 'Overview': \"Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath. Some heart conditions slowly leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump blood properly. These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure. Proper treatment may improve the symptoms of heart failure and may help some people live longer. Lifestyle changes can improve quality of life. Try to lose weight, exercise, use less salt and manage stress. But heart failure can be life-threatening. People with heart failure may have severe symptoms. Some may need a heart transplant or a device to help the heart pump blood. Heart failure also may be called congestive heart failure.\", 'Symptoms': \"If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs. Symptoms may develop slowly. Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. Heart failure symptoms may include:\", 'Causes': \"Heart failure can be caused by a weakened, damaged or stiff heart. The heart muscle can be damaged by certain infections, heavy alcohol use, recreational drug use and some chemotherapy medicines. Your genes also can play a role. Any of the following conditions also can damage or weaken the heart and cause heart failure. Causes of sudden heart failure also include: Heart failure usually begins with the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. This is the heart's main pumping chamber. But heart failure also can affect the right side. The lower right heart chamber is called the right ventricle. Sometimes heart failure affects both sides of the heart.\", 'Diagnosis': None, 'Treatment': None}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Meningitis', 'Overview': 'Meningitis is an infection and swelling, called inflammation, of the fluid and membranes around the brain and spinal cord. These membranes are called meninges. The inflammation from meningitis most often triggers symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck. Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States. Bacteria, parasites and fungi also can cause it. Sometimes meningitis improves in a few weeks without treatment. But meningitis also can cause death. It often needs quick treatment with antibiotics. Seek medical care right away if you think that you or someone in your family has meningitis. For meningitis caused by bacteria, early treatment can prevent serious complications.', 'Symptoms': 'Early meningitis symptoms may be like those of the flu. Symptoms may come on over several hours or over a few days.', 'Causes': 'Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States, followed by bacterial infections and, rarely, fungal and parasitic infections.

They are spread mainly by sexual contact. STIs are caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites. A sexually transmitted infection may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids. Sometimes sexually transmitted infections are spread in ways other than sexual contact. For example, STIs can spread to infants during pregnancy or childbirth. STIs also can spread through blood transfusions or shared needles. STIs don't always cause symptoms. A person can get sexually transmitted infections from another person who seems healthy and may not even know they have an infection.\", 'Symptoms': \"STDs can have a range of symptoms, including no symptoms. That's why sexually transmitted infections may go unnoticed until a person has complications or a partner is diagnosed.

      "{'disease': 'COPD', 'Overview': \"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an ongoing lung condition caused by damage to the lungs. The damage results in swelling and irritation, also called inflammation, inside the airways that limit airflow into and out of the lungs. This limited airflow is known as obstruction. Symptoms include trouble breathing, a daily cough that brings up mucus and a tight, whistling sound in the lungs called wheezing. COPD is most often caused by long-term exposure to irritating smoke, fumes, dust or chemicals. The most common cause is cigarette smoke. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common types of COPD. These two conditions usually occur together and can vary in severity among people with COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the tubes that bring air into the lungs. These tubes are called bronchi. The inflammation prevents good airflow into and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus. In emphysema, the small air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, are damaged. The damaged alveoli can't pass enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Although COPD is a condition that can get worse over time, COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can control symptoms and improve their quality of life. Proper management also can lower the risk of other conditions linked to COPD, such as heart disease and lung cancer.\", 'Symptoms': \"COPD symptoms often don't appear until a lot of lung damage has occurred. Symptoms usually worsen over time, especially if smoking or other irritating exposure continues. Symptoms of COPD may include: People with COPD also are likely to have times when their symptoms become worse than the usual day-to-day variation. This time of worsening symptoms is called an exacerbation (eg-zas-er-bay-shun). Exacerbations can last for several days to weeks. They can be caused by triggers such as smells, cold air, air pollution, colds or infections. Symptoms may include:\", 'Causes': \"The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking. In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in homes that don't have good airflow. Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace is another cause of COPD. Not all people who have smoked for a long time have COPD symptoms, but they may still have lung damage, so their lungs don't work as well as they used to. Some people who smoke get less common lung conditions that may be diagnosed as COPD until a more thorough exam shows a different diagnosis.\", 'Diagnosis': None, 'Treatment': None}\n",

Your white blood cells are potent infection fighters — they normally grow and divide in an orderly way, as your body needs them.

The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or more commonly, SARS-CoV-2. It started spreading at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic disease in 2020. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads most commonly through the air in tiny droplets of fluid between people in close contact. Many people with COVID-19 have no symptoms or mild illness. But for older adults and people with certain medical conditions, COVID-19 can lead to the need for care in the hospital or death. Staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccine helps prevent serious illness, the need for hospital care due to COVID-19 and death from COVID-19. Other ways that may help prevent the spread of this coronavirus includes good indoor air flow, physical distancing, wearing a mask in the right setting and good hygiene. Medicine can limit the seriousness of the viral infection. Most people recover without long-term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months.',\n",
       "  'Symptoms': \"Typical COVID-19 symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus. Symptoms can include: People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms of COVID-19 illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spread COVID-19 to others. Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start. Most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. But COVID-19 can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. COVID-19 may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness. Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened to MIS-C. In adults, the name is MIS-A.\",\n",
       "  'Causes': \"COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also called SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, even from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, breathe, sing or talk, their breath may be infected with the COVID-19 virus. The coronavirus carried by a person's breath can land directly on the face of a nearby person, after a sneeze or cough, for example. The droplets or particles the infected person breathes out could possibly be breathed in by other people if they are close together or in areas with low air flow. And a person may touch a surface that has respiratory droplets and then touch their face with hands that have the coronavirus on them. It's possible to get COVID-19 more than once. The virus that causes COVID-19 can infect some pets. Cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets have caught this coronavirus and had symptoms. It's rare for a person to get COVID-19 from a pet.\",\n",

       "  'Overview': \"Obesity is a complex disease involving having too much body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It's a medical problem that increases the risk of many other diseases and health problems. These can include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers. There are many reasons why some people have trouble losing weight. Often, obesity results from inherited, physiological and environmental factors, combined with diet, physical activity and exercise choices. The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. A healthier diet, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medicines and weight-loss procedures are other options for treating obesity.\",\n",
       "  'Symptoms': \"Body mass index, known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. To calculate BMI, multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches. Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are several online calculators available that help calculate BMI. See BMI calculator Asians with a BMI of 23 or higher may have an increased risk of health problems. For most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However, BMI doesn't directly measure body fat. Some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obesity category even though they don't have excess body fat. Many health care professionals also measure around a person's waist to help guide treatment decisions. This measurement is called a waist circumference. Weight-related health problems are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches (102 centimeters). They're more common in women with a waist measurement over 35 inches (89 centimeters). Body fat percentage is another measurement that may be used during a weight loss program to track progress.\",\n",
       "  'Causes': \"Although there are genetic, behavioral, metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through typical daily activities and exercise. Your body stores these excess calories as fat. In the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. People with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full, feel hungry sooner, or eat more due to stress or anxiety. Many people who live in Western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding, so they don't tend to burn as many calories at work. Even daily activities use fewer calories, courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls, escalators, online shopping, and drive-through restaurants and banks.\",\n",

       " {'disease': \"Alzheimer's disease\",\n",
       "  'Overview': \"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink. About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease. Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death. But medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers.\",\n",
       "  'Symptoms': \"Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur. At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. Brain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time.\",\n",
       "  'Causes': \"The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. But at a basic level, brain proteins don't function as usual. This disrupts the work of brain cells, also known as neurons, and triggers a series of events. The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. They eventually die. Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. In less than 1% of people, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. For people in this group, the disease usually begins in middle age. The disease begins years before the first symptoms. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that manages memory. The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk. Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer's disease are focused on the role of two proteins:\",\n",

This can lead to belly pain, severe diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can affect different areas of the digestive tract in different people. Crohn's most commonly affects the end of the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine. The inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel. Crohn's disease can be both painful and debilitating. Sometimes, it may lead to serious or life-threatening complications. There's no known cure for Crohn's disease, but therapies can greatly reduce its symptoms and even bring about long-term remission and healing of inflammation. With treatment, many people with Crohn's disease can function well.\",\n",

It most commonly involves the last part of the small intestine. In some people, the disease is only in the colon or the large intestine. Symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe. They usually develop gradually, but sometimes might come on suddenly, without warning. Someone with Crohn's disease also may have periods of time with no symptoms. This is known as remission.\",\n",

      "{'disease': 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)', 'Overview': 'COVID-19, also called coronavirus disease 2019, is an illness caused by a virus. The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or more commonly, SARS-CoV-2. It started spreading at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic disease in 2020. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads most commonly through the air in tiny droplets of fluid between people in close contact. Many people with COVID-19 have no symptoms or mild illness. But for older adults and people with certain medical conditions, COVID-19 can lead to the need for care in the hospital or death. Staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccine helps prevent serious illness, the need for hospital care due to COVID-19 and death from COVID-19. Other ways that may help prevent the spread of this coronavirus includes good indoor air flow, physical distancing, wearing a mask in the right setting and good hygiene. Medicine can limit the seriousness of the viral infection. Most people recover without long-term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months.', 'Symptoms': \"Typical COVID-19 symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus. Symptoms can include: People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms of COVID-19 illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spread COVID-19 to others. Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start. Most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. But COVID-19 can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness. COVID-19 may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness. Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened to MIS-C. In adults, the name is MIS-A.\", 'Causes': \"COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also called SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, even from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, breathe, sing or talk, their breath may be infected with the COVID-19 virus. The coronavirus carried by a person's breath can land directly on the face of a nearby person, after a sneeze or cough, for example. The droplets or particles the infected person breathes out could possibly be breathed in by other people if they are close together or in areas with low air flow. And a person may touch a surface that has respiratory droplets and then touch their face with hands that have the coronavirus on them. It's possible to get COVID-19 more than once. The virus that causes COVID-19 can infect some pets. Cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets have caught this coronavirus and had symptoms. It's rare for a person to get COVID-19 from a pet.\"}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Heart disease', 'Overview': 'Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Heart disease includes: Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.', 'Symptoms': 'Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease.', 'Causes': 'Heart disease causes depend on the specific type of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease.'}\n",
      "{'disease': \"COVID-19: Who's at higher risk of serious symptoms?\", 'Overview': None, 'Symptoms': None, 'Causes': None}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Obesity', 'Overview': \"Obesity is a complex disease involving having too much body fat. Obesity isn't just a cosmetic concern. It's a medical problem that increases the risk of many other diseases and health problems. These can include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers. There are many reasons why some people have trouble losing weight. Often, obesity results from inherited, physiological and environmental factors, combined with diet, physical activity and exercise choices. The good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health problems associated with obesity. A healthier diet, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medicines and weight-loss procedures are other options for treating obesity.\", 'Symptoms': \"Body mass index, known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. To calculate BMI, multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches. Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are several online calculators available that help calculate BMI. See BMI calculator Asians with a BMI of 23 or higher may have an increased risk of health problems. For most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However, BMI doesn't directly measure body fat. Some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obesity category even though they don't have excess body fat. Many health care professionals also measure around a person's waist to help guide treatment decisions. This measurement is called a waist circumference. Weight-related health problems are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches (102 centimeters). They're more common in women with a waist measurement over 35 inches (89 centimeters). Body fat percentage is another measurement that may be used during a weight loss program to track progress.\", 'Causes': \"Although there are genetic, behavioral, metabolic and hormonal influences on body weight, obesity occurs when you take in more calories than you burn through typical daily activities and exercise. Your body stores these excess calories as fat. In the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. People with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full, feel hungry sooner, or eat more due to stress or anxiety. Many people who live in Western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding, so they don't tend to burn as many calories at work. Even daily activities use fewer calories, courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls, escalators, online shopping, and drive-through restaurants and banks.\"}\n",
      "{'disease': \"Alzheimer's disease\", 'Overview': \"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink. About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease. Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death. But medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers.\", 'Symptoms': \"Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur. At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. Brain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time.\", 'Causes': \"The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. But at a basic level, brain proteins don't function as usual. This disrupts the work of brain cells, also known as neurons, and triggers a series of events. The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. They eventually die. Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. In less than 1% of people, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. For people in this group, the disease usually begins in middle age. The disease begins years before the first symptoms. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that manages memory. The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk. Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer's disease are focused on the role of two proteins:\"}\n",

      "{'disease': 'Influenza (flu)', 'Overview': 'Flu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the \"stomach flu\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn\\'t 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications. Aside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving.', 'Symptoms': 'The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May. Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu. Other common flu symptoms include: In children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu. In some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes.', 'Causes': \"Influenza is caused by viruses. These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. It's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often. A person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people.\"}\n",

Multiple sclerosis can cause numbness, weakness, trouble walking, vision changes and other symptoms. It's also known as MS. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers, known as myelin. This interrupts communication between the brain and the rest of the body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage of the nerve fibers. Symptoms of MS depend on the person, the location of damage in the nervous system and how bad the damage is to the nerve fibers. Some people lose the ability to walk on their own or move at all. Others may have long periods between attacks without any new symptoms, called remission. The course of the disease varies depending on the type of MS. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.\", 'Symptoms': \"Multiple sclerosis symptoms vary depending on the person. Symptoms may change over the course of the disease depending on which nerve fibers are affected. Common symptoms include: Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen symptoms of MS. These aren't considered true disease relapses but pseudorelapses.\", 'Causes': \"The cause of multiple sclerosis is not known. It's considered an immune-mediated disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks and destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This fatty substance is called myelin. Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages traveling along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked. It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors may increase the risk of MS.\"}\n",

      "{'disease': 'COPD', 'Overview': \"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an ongoing lung condition caused by damage to the lungs. The damage results in swelling and irritation, also called inflammation, inside the airways that limit airflow into and out of the lungs. This limited airflow is known as obstruction. Symptoms include trouble breathing, a daily cough that brings up mucus and a tight, whistling sound in the lungs called wheezing. COPD is most often caused by long-term exposure to irritating smoke, fumes, dust or chemicals. The most common cause is cigarette smoke. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common types of COPD. These two conditions usually occur together and can vary in severity among people with COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the tubes that bring air into the lungs. These tubes are called bronchi. The inflammation prevents good airflow into and out of the lungs and makes extra mucus. In emphysema, the small air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, are damaged. The damaged alveoli can't pass enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Although COPD is a condition that can get worse over time, COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can control symptoms and improve their quality of life. Proper management also can lower the risk of other conditions linked to COPD, such as heart disease and lung cancer.\", 'Symptoms': \"COPD symptoms often don't appear until a lot of lung damage has occurred. Symptoms usually worsen over time, especially if smoking or other irritating exposure continues. Symptoms of COPD may include: People with COPD also are likely to have times when their symptoms become worse than the usual day-to-day variation. This time of worsening symptoms is called an exacerbation (eg-zas-er-bay-shun). Exacerbations can last for several days to weeks.

In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in homes that don't have good airflow. Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace is another cause of COPD. Not all people who have smoked for a long time have COPD symptoms, but they may still have lung damage, so their lungs don't work as well as they used to. Some people who smoke get less common lung conditions that may be diagnosed as COPD until a more thorough exam shows a different diagnosis.\"}\n",

When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania, you may feel very excited and happy (euphoric), full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings from depression to mania may occur rarely or multiple times a year. Each bout usually lasts several days. Between episodes, some people have long periods of emotional stability. Others may frequently have mood swings from depression to mania or both depression and mania at the same time.

That sugar also is called glucose. This long-term condition results in too much sugar circulating in the blood. Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems. In type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two problems. The pancreas does not produce enough insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells. And cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar. Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people. There's no cure for type 2 diabetes.

CF affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These fluids, also called secretions, are usually thin and slippery to protect the body's internal tubes and ducts and make them smooth pathways. But in people with CF, a changed gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. The secretions plug up pathways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. CF gets worse over time and needs daily care, but people with CF usually can attend school and work. They often have a better quality of life than people with CF had in past decades. Better screening and treatments mean that people with CF now may live into their mid- to late 50s or longer, and some are being diagnosed later in life.\", 'Symptoms': \"In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the symptoms of CF show up. CF symptoms vary, depending on which organs are affected and how severe the condition is. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or get better at different times. Some people may not have symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder symptoms and are more likely to have symptoms that aren't typical. These may include repeated bouts of an inflamed pancreas called pancreatitis, infertility and repeated bouts of pneumonia. People with CF have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system.\", 'Causes': \"In cystic fibrosis, a change in a gene causes problems with the protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. This gene is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. It affects the cells that make mucus, sweat and digestive juices. When the CFTR protein doesn't work as it should, the result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as extra salt in sweat. Changes in the CFTR gene that cause CF are divided into several different groups based on the problems they cause. Different groups of gene changes affect how much CFTR protein is made and how well it works. To have cystic fibrosis, children must get one copy of the changed CFTR gene from each parent. If children get only one copy, they won't develop CF. But they will be carriers and could pass the changed gene to their own children. People who are carriers may have no symptoms of CF or a few mild symptoms.\"}\n",

Rarely, it can happen inside the body, such as in the nose or throat. The exact cause of all melanomas isn't clear. Most melanomas are caused by exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from sunlight or tanning lamps and beds. Limiting exposure to UV light can help reduce the risk of melanoma. The risk of melanoma seems to be increasing in people under 40, especially women.

Melanoma also can happen inside the body. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin.\", 'Causes': \"Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells. Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin. Melanoma starts when melanocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. It isn't clear what changes the DNA in skin cells and how it leads to melanoma. It's likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors. Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds. UV light doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma.\"}\n",

People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic). Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).', 'Symptoms': \"If you have acute bronchitis, you may have cold symptoms, such as:  While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. For chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: Chronic bronchitis is typically defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with bouts that recur for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. It's also possible to have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis.\", 'Causes': \"Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Many different viruses — all of which are very contagious — can cause acute bronchitis. Antibiotics don't kill viruses, so this type of medication isn't useful in most cases of bronchitis. Viruses spread mainly from person to person by droplets produced when an ill person coughs, sneezes or talks and you inhale the droplets. Viruses may also spread through contact with an infected object. This happens when you touch something with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, eyes or nose. The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition.\"}\n",

Epilepsy affects people of all genders, races, ethnic backgrounds and ages. Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people may lose awareness during a seizure while others don't. Some people stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure. Others may repeatedly twitch their arms or legs, movements known as convulsions. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. Epilepsy is diagnosed if you've had at least two unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart. Unprovoked seizures don't have a clear cause. Treatment with medicines or sometimes surgery can control seizures for most people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment. For others, seizures go away.

It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.', 'Symptoms': \"The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include: Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating. See your doctor if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus. It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a doctor: For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.\", 'Causes': 'Many germs can cause pneumonia. The most common are bacteria and viruses in the air we breathe. Your body usually prevents these germs from infecting your lungs. But sometimes these germs can overpower your immune system, even if your health is generally good. Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection. Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia. It occurs outside of hospitals or other health care facilities. It may be caused by: Some people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia. Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when you inhale food, drink, vomit or saliva into your lungs. Aspiration is more likely if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury or swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs.'}\n",

If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response to the gluten protein in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents it from absorbing nutrients, a condition called malabsorption. The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating or anemia. It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms. There's no definite cure for celiac disease. But for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and help the intestines heal.\", 'Symptoms': 'The symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly. They also may be different in children and adults. Digestive symptoms for adults include: However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including:', 'Causes': \"Your genes, combined with eating foods with gluten and other factors, can contribute to celiac disease. However, the precise cause isn't known. Infant-feeding practices, gastrointestinal infections and gut bacteria may contribute, but these causes have not been proved. Sometimes celiac disease becomes active after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress. When the body's immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the reaction damages the tiny, hairlike projections, called villi, that line the small intestine. Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat. If your villi are damaged, you can't get enough nutrients, no matter how much you eat.\"}\n",

Mild dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death. Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each year. Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia, the western Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. But the disease has been spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe and southern parts of the United States. Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. For now, in areas where dengue fever is common, the best ways to prevent infection are to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take steps to reduce the mosquito population.', 'Symptoms': 'Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection. When symptoms do occur, they may be mistaken for other illnesses — such as the flu — and usually begin four to 10 days after you are bitten by an infected mosquito. Dengue fever causes a high fever — 104 F (40 C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms: Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and even death. Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly.

You can't get dengue fever from being around an infected person. Instead, dengue fever is spread through mosquito bites. The two types of mosquitoes that most often spread the dengue viruses are common both in and around human lodgings. When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito. Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection. After you've recovered from dengue fever, you have long-term immunity to the type of virus that infected you — but not to the other three dengue fever virus types. This means you can be infected again in the future by one of the other three virus types. Your risk of developing severe dengue fever increases if you get dengue fever a second, third or fourth time.\"}\n",

Osteoporosis-related breaks most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine. Bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn't keep up with the loss of old bone. Osteoporosis affects men and women of all races. But white and Asian women, especially older women who are past menopause, are at highest risk. Medicines, healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones.\", 'Symptoms': 'There typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss. But once your bones have been weakened by osteoporosis, you might have signs and symptoms that include:', 'Causes': 'Your bones are in a constant state of renewal — new bone is made and old bone is broken down. When you\\'re young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it\\'s created. How likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth. Peak bone mass is partly inherited and varies also by ethnic group. The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have \"in the bank\" and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age.'}\n",

Endometriosis tissue acts as the lining inside the uterus would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. But it grows in places where it doesn't belong, and it doesn't leave the body. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated and form scar tissue. Bands of fibrous tissue called adhesions also may form. These can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other. Endometriosis can cause pain, especially during menstrual periods. Fertility problems also may develop. But treatments can help you take charge of the condition and its complications.\", 'Symptoms': \"The main symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain. It's often linked with menstrual periods. Although many people have cramping during their periods, those with endometriosis often describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. The pain also may become worse over time. Common symptoms of endometriosis include: The seriousness of your pain may not be a sign of the number or extent of endometriosis growths in your body. You could have a small amount of tissue with bad pain. Or you could have lots of endometriosis tissue with little or no pain. Still, some people with endometriosis have no symptoms.

It may result in a mix of hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking and behavior. Hallucinations involve seeing things or hearing voices that aren't observed by others. Delusions involve firm beliefs about things that are not true. People with schizophrenia can seem to lose touch with reality, which can make daily living very hard. People with schizophrenia need lifelong treatment. This includes medicine, talk therapy and help in learning how to manage daily life activities. Because many people with schizophrenia don't know they have a mental health condition and may not believe they need treatment, many research studies have examined the results of untreated psychosis. People who have psychosis that is not treated often have more-severe symptoms, more stays in a hospital, poorer thinking and processing skills and social outcomes, injuries, and even death. On the other hand, early treatment often helps control symptoms before serious complications arise, making the long-term outlook better.\", 'Symptoms': \"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems in how people think, feel and behave. Symptoms may include: Symptoms can vary in type and how severe they are. At times, symptoms may get better or worse. Some symptoms may be present at all times. People with schizophrenia usually are diagnosed in the late teen years to early 30s. In men, schizophrenia symptoms usually start in the late teens to early 20s. In women, symptoms usually begin in the late 20s to early 30s. There also is a group of people — usually women — who are diagnosed later in life.

In its most serious form, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition need treatment in a hospital. Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. But two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin. Infections can include a respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, including COVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus. There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several treatment options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal.

Sometimes, it causes disfigurement. Smallpox has affected humans for thousands of years but was wiped out worldwide by 1980 thanks to smallpox vaccines. It's no longer found naturally in the world. The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was reported in 1977. Samples of smallpox virus have been kept for research purposes. And scientific advances have made it possible to create smallpox in a lab. This has led to concerns that smallpox could someday be used as a bioweapon.

When exposed to HPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells. You can reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer by having screening tests and receiving a vaccine that protects against HPV infection. When cervical cancer happens, it's often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells. Options might include chemotherapy and targeted therapy medicines. Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used. Sometimes treatment combines radiation with low-dose chemotherapy.\", 'Symptoms': 'When it starts, cervical cancer might not cause symptoms.

      "{'disease': 'Tetanus', 'Overview': \"Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin-producing bacterium. The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw. Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve. Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations. It's more common in developing countries.\", 'Symptoms': 'The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include: Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:', 'Causes': 'The bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani. The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces. It\\'s essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive. When the dormant bacteria enter a wound — a condition good for growth — the cells are \"awakened.\" As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin. The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles.'}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Polio', 'Overview': 'Polio is an illness caused by a virus that mainly affects nerves in the spinal cord or brain stem. In its most severe form, polio can lead to a person being unable to move certain limbs, also called paralysis. It can also lead to trouble breathing and sometimes death. The disease also is called poliomyelitis. A vaccination effort throughout the world has led to only a small number of cases to occur around the world in recent years. But poliovirus still spreads within areas with low vaccination rates. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes travel notices of countries where there is a higher risk of polio. Countries at a higher risk of polio are generally in Africa, the Middle East, and southern and central Asia. Vaccinated adults who plan to travel to an area where polio is spreading should get a booster dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Immunity after a booster lasts a lifetime.', 'Symptoms': \"Most people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don't get symptoms.\", 'Causes': \"Polio is caused by the poliovirus. It mainly targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem that control muscle movement. Nerve cells controlling sensation are generally not affected. The naturally-occurring poliovirus, called the wild-type poliovirus, has been eliminated in most countries and causes few cases of polio. Another version of the virus, called the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), is more widespread and now causes most infections worldwide. VDPV exists mainly in a few countries that use an oral vaccine with a weakened poliovirus. The weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't itself cause polio, and vaccinated people rarely contract VDPV. Instead, VDPV is a new version of the virus that develops within a community or region where not enough people are vaccinated. Even though the weakened virus in the oral vaccine doesn't cause illness, it can spread. If most people in a community are vaccinated, the spread of the weakened virus is controlled. If many people aren't vaccinated, the weakened virus can move through a community for a long time. This gives the virus the chance to change, or mutate, and behave like the wild-type virus that causes illness. Infections from VDPV have been reported in the United States. In each case, the person was either not vaccinated or had a significantly weakened immune system. One case in New York in 2022 was in a county with a lower-than-average polio vaccination rate. Samples from wastewater showed that VDPV was spreading in some communities. Since 2000, polio vaccination in the United States has used an injected vaccine with an inactivated poliovirus that doesn't create the risk for VDPV.\"}\n",

In some people, the condition can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities.\", 'Symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first — particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40% of people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Areas that may be affected include: Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission — when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place.\", 'Causes': \"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Normally, your immune system helps protect your body from infection and disease. In rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your joints. It can also cause medical problems with your heart, lungs, nerves, eyes and skin. Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely.

      "{'disease': 'Tay-Sachs disease', 'Overview': \"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child. It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells. In the most common and severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, signs and symptoms start to show up at about 3 to 6 months of age. As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken. Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues. Children with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically live only a few years. Less commonly, some children have the juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease and may live into their teen years. Rarely, some adults have a late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease which is often less severe than forms that begin in childhood. If you have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease or if you're a member of a high-risk group and plan to have children, health care providers strongly recommend genetic testing and genetic counseling.\", 'Symptoms': 'There are three forms of Tay-Sachs disease: infantile, juvenile and late onset/adult.', 'Causes': 'Tay-Sachs disease is a genetic disorder that is passed from parents to their children. It occurs when a child inherits a flaw (mutation) in the HEXA gene from both parents. The genetic change that causes Tay-Sachs disease results in a deficiency of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A. This enzyme is required to break down the fatty substance GM2 ganglioside. The buildup of fatty substances damages nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Severity and age of onset of the disease relates to how much enzyme is still produced.'}\n",

This condition often causes weakness, numbness and pain, usually in the hands and feet. It also can affect other areas and body functions including digestion and urination. The peripheral nervous system sends information from the brain and spinal cord, also called the central nervous system, to the rest of the body through motor nerves. The peripheral nerves also send sensory information to the central nervous system through sensory nerves. Peripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes. People with peripheral neuropathy usually describe the pain as stabbing, burning or tingling. Sometimes symptoms get better, especially if caused by a condition that can be treated. Medicines can reduce the pain of peripheral neuropathy.', 'Symptoms': \"Every nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected.

      "{'disease': 'Autism spectrum disorder', 'Overview': 'Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. The disorder also includes limited and repetitive patterns of behavior. The term \"spectrum\" in autism spectrum disorder refers to the wide range of symptoms and severity. Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate — autism, Asperger\\'s syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder. Some people still use the term \"Asperger\\'s syndrome,\" which is generally thought to be at the mild end of autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder begins in early childhood and eventually causes problems functioning in society — socially, in school and at work, for example. Often children show symptoms of autism within the first year. A small number of children appear to develop normally in the first year, and then go through a period of regression between 18 and 24 months of age when they develop autism symptoms. While there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, intensive, early treatment can make a big difference in the lives of many children.', 'Symptoms': \"Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning. Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.\", 'Causes': 'Autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause. Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. Both genetics and environment may play a role.'}\n",

Sometimes children have trouble breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for 1 to 2 weeks but occasionally can last longer. Most children get better with care at home. A small number of children need a stay in the hospital.', 'Symptoms': 'For the first few days, the symptoms of bronchiolitis are much like a cold: Later, your child may have a week or more of working harder than usual to breathe, which may include wheezing. Many infants with bronchiolitis also have an ear infection called otitis media.', 'Causes': 'Bronchiolitis happens when a virus infects the bronchioles, which are the smallest airways in the lungs. The infection makes the bronchioles swollen and irritated. Mucus collects in these airways, which makes it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs. Bronchiolitis is usually caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a common virus that infects just about every child by 2 years of age. Outbreaks of RSV infection often happen during the colder months of the year in some locations or the rainy season in others. A person can get it more than once. Bronchiolitis also can be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the flu or the common cold. The viruses that cause bronchiolitis are easily spread. You can get them through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks.

Most of these conditions cause inflammation and progressive scarring of lung tissue. As part of this process, lung tissue thickens and stiffens, making it hard for the lungs to expand and fill with air. At some point, the scarring from interstitial lung disease makes it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen into the bloodstream. Many people with ILD are short of breath with activity and may have a bothersome dry cough. Interstitial lung disease can have many causes, including long-term exposure to hazardous materials such as asbestos. Some types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, also can cause interstitial lung disease. But the cause isn't known sometimes. ILD can have many causes, so treatment varies. The disease may get worse slowly or rapidly at a pace that often can't be predicted. Once lung scarring occurs, it generally isn't reversible. Treatment focuses on keeping more scarring from occurring, managing symptoms and making quality of life better.

Purines are also found in certain foods, including red meat and organ meats, such as liver. Purine-rich seafood includes anchovies, sardines, mussels, scallops, trout and tuna. Alcoholic beverages, especially beer, and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) promote higher levels of uric acid. Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. But sometimes either your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys excrete too little uric acid. When this happens, uric acid can build up, forming sharp, needlelike urate crystals in a joint or surrounding tissue that cause pain, inflammation and swelling.'}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Porphyria', 'Overview': \"Porphyria (por-FEAR-e-uh) refers to a group of rare disorders that result from a buildup of natural chemicals called porphyrins in the body. Porphyrins are needed to make heme, a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues. Eight enzymes are needed to change porphyrins into heme. Without enough of any of these enzymes, porphyrins build up in the body. High levels of porphyrins can cause major problems, mainly in the nervous system and skin. There are two general types of porphyrias. Acute porphyrias start rapidly and mainly affect the nervous system. Cutaneous porphyrias mainly affect the skin. A few types of porphyrias affect both the nervous system and the skin. Symptoms of porphyria vary, depending on the specific type of porphyria and how severe it is. Porphyria is usually inherited. One or both parents pass along a changed gene to their child. Although porphyria can't be cured, medicines and certain lifestyle changes may help you manage it. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of porphyria you have.\", 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are. Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms.', 'Causes': 'All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body. Heme is made in the bone marrow and liver. This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme. A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins. Which enzyme is affected determines the type of porphyria. In cutaneous porphyrias, porphyrins build up in the skin. When exposed to sunlight, they cause symptoms. In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms.'}\n",

The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet, 1 inch (125 cm) for women and 4 feet, 4 inches (132 cm) for men. Many medical conditions cause dwarfism. In general, dwarfism is divided into two broad categories: Some people prefer the term \"short stature\" or \"little people\" rather than \"dwarf\" or \"dwarfism.\" It\\'s important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this condition. Short stature conditions don\\'t include familial short stature — short height that\\'s thought of as a typical variation with typical bone development.', 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms — other than short stature — vary greatly across the range of dwarfism conditions.', 'Causes': \"Most often dwarfism is caused by gene changes, also called genetic variants. In many children, it's due to a random change in a child's gene. But dwarfism also can be inherited due to a genetic variant in one or both parents. Other causes can include low levels of hormones and poor nutrition. Sometimes the cause of dwarfism is not known.\"}\n",

Sexually transmitted diseases are infections spread mainly by contact with genitals or bodily fluids. Also called STDs, STIs or venereal disease, sexually transmitted infections are caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites. Gonorrhea bacteria can infect the urethra, rectum, female reproductive tract, mouth, throat or eyes. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during vaginal, oral or anal sexual activity. But babies can get the infection during childbirth. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Avoiding sexual activity and not having sex prevents the spread of gonorrhea. Using a condom during sexual activity can help prevent the spread of gonorrhea. Being in a mutually monogamous relationship, in which both partners have sex only with each other and neither partner is infected, also limits the risk of an infection.', 'Symptoms': 'In many people, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they often affect the genital tract, but also may occur in other places.', 'Causes': 'Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse.'}\n",

The need to scratch may be stronger at night. Scabies is contagious and can spread quickly through close person-to-person contact in a family, child care group, school class, nursing home or prison. Because scabies spreads so easily, health care providers often recommend treating the entire family or any close contacts. Scabies is easily treated. Medicated skin creams or pills kill the mites that cause scabies and their eggs. But itching may not stop for many weeks after treatment.', 'Symptoms': \"Scabies symptoms include: Scabies is often found in the skin folds. But scabies can appear on many parts of the body. In adults and older children, scabies is most often found: In infants and young children, common sites of scabies usually include the: If you've had scabies before, symptoms may start within a few days of exposure. If you've never had scabies, it can take as long as six weeks for symptoms to start. You can still spread scabies even if you don't have any symptoms yet.\", 'Causes': \"Scabies is caused by a tiny, eight-legged mite. The female mite burrows just under the skin and makes a tunnel where it lays eggs. The eggs hatch, and the mite larvae travel to the surface of the skin, where they mature. These mites can then spread to other areas of the skin or to the skin of other people. Itching is caused by the body's allergic reaction to the mites, their eggs and their waste. Close skin-to-skin contact and, less often, sharing clothing or bedding with a person who has scabies can spread the mites. Pets don't spread scabies to humans. The scabies mites that affect animals don't survive or reproduce in people. However, coming in contact with an animal that has scabies may cause brief itching if the mite gets under the skin. But within a few days, the mite will die. So treatment isn't needed.\"}\n",

The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring. Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 40. It can persist for many years and worsen over time. It can affect your daily life and emotional well-being. Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications. Women are three times more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa, though this ratio can differ by location around the world. Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races. This could be attributed to genetic factors.', 'Symptoms': \"Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body.

Connective tissue is a complex mixture of proteins and other substances that provide strength and elasticity to the underlying structures in your body. People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome usually have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin. This can become a problem if you have a wound that requires stitches, because the skin often isn't strong enough to hold them. A more severe form of the disorder, called vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can cause the walls of your blood vessels, intestines or uterus to rupture.

      "{'disease': 'Amnesia', 'Overview': \"Amnesia refers to the loss of memories, including facts, information and experiences. Movies and television tend to depict amnesia as forgetting your identity, but that's not generally the case in real life. Instead, people with amnesia — also called amnestic syndrome — usually know who they are. But they may have trouble learning new information and forming new memories. Amnesia can be caused by damage to areas of the brain that are vital for memory processing. Unlike a temporary episode of memory loss, called transient global amnesia, amnesia can be permanent. There's no specific treatment for amnesia, but treatment can be directed at the underlying cause. Tips to help enhance memory and get support can help people with amnesia and their families cope.\", 'Symptoms': \"The two main features of amnesia are: Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared. For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast. Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder. Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills. Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia.\", 'Causes': \"Typical memory function involves many parts of the brain. Any disease or injury that affects the brain can affect memory. Amnesia can result from damage to brain structures that form the limbic system, which controls emotions and memories. They include the thalamus found deep within the center of the brain. They also include the hippocampal formations found within the temporal lobes of the brain. Amnesia caused by brain injury or damage is known as neurological amnesia. Possible causes of neurological amnesia include: Head injuries that cause a concussion, whether from a car accident or sports, can lead to confusion and problems remembering new information. This is especially common in the early stages of recovery. Mild head injuries typically don't cause lasting amnesia, but more-severe head injuries may cause permanent amnesia. Another rare type of amnesia, called dissociative amnesia, stems from emotional shock or trauma. It can result from being the victim of a violent crime or experiencing other trauma. In this disorder, people may lose personal memories and information about their lives. The memory loss is usually brief.\"}\n",

New or different symptoms may signal unstable angina or a heart attack. Any new or worsening angina symptoms need to be checked immediately by a healthcare professional. The healthcare team can determine whether you have stable or unstable angina.', 'Causes': \"Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Blood carries oxygen, which the heart muscle needs to survive. When the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen, it causes a condition called ischemia. The most common cause of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is coronary artery disease (CAD). The heart arteries, called the coronary arteries, can become narrowed by fatty deposits called plaques. This condition is called atherosclerosis. Plaque in a blood vessel may rupture or cause a blood clot. These events can quickly block or reduce flow through a narrowed artery. This can suddenly and severely decrease blood flow to the heart muscle. The heart muscle may still be able to work during times of low oxygen demand without triggering angina symptoms. An example is when resting. But when the demand for oxygen goes up, such as when exercising, angina can result.\"}\n",

Treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are available. One treatment is a device that uses positive pressure to keep the airway open during sleep. Another option is a mouthpiece to thrust the lower jaw forward during sleep. In some people, surgery might be an option too.', 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include:', 'Causes': \"Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax too much to allow for proper breathing. These muscles support the back of the roof of the mouth, known as the soft palate. The muscles also support the tongue and side walls of the throat. When the muscles relax, the airway narrows or closes as you breathe in. This can lower the level of oxygen in the blood and cause a buildup of carbon dioxide. Your brain senses this impaired breathing and briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway. This awakening is usually so brief that you don't remember it. You may awaken with shortness of breath that corrects itself quickly, within one or two deep breaths. Or you might make a snorting, choking or gasping sound. This pattern can repeat itself 5 to 30 times or more each hour, all night long. These disruptions impair your ability to reach the deep, restful phases of sleep, and you'll probably feel sleepy during your waking hours.

      "{'disease': 'Low blood pressure (hypotension)', 'Overview': \"Low blood pressure is a condition in which the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is too low. It's also called hypotension. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, low blood pressure is a reading lower than 90/60 mm Hg. What's considered low blood pressure for one person might be OK for someone else though. Low blood pressure might cause no symptoms that you notice. Or it might cause dizziness and fainting. Sometimes, low blood pressure can be life-threatening. The causes of low blood pressure include dehydration and other serious medical conditions. It's important to find out what's causing low blood pressure so that it can be treated, if needed.\", 'Symptoms': \"Low blood pressure symptoms can include: For some people, low blood pressure may be a symptom of an underlying health condition. That's especially so when blood pressure drops suddenly or when low blood pressure occurs with symptoms. A sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg can make you feel dizzy or faint. For example, those symptoms could happen after a drop in systolic pressure from 110 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg. And big drops can be life-threatening. These can happen for reasons such as serious bleeding, serious infections or allergic reactions. Extreme low blood pressure can lead to a condition known as shock. Symptoms of shock include:\", 'Causes': 'Low blood pressure has various causes. Some health conditions and the use of certain medicines can cause it. Other factors affect blood pressure as well. Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood the heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in the arteries. A blood pressure reading has two numbers: The American Heart Association classifies healthy blood pressure as normal. Normal blood pressure usually is lower than 120/80 mm Hg. Blood pressure varies throughout the day. It depends on: Blood pressure usually is lowest at night and rises sharply on waking.'}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Personality disorders', 'Overview': \"People have unique personalities made up of a complex combination of different traits. Personality traits affect how people understand and relate to the world around them, as well as how they see themselves. Ideally, people's personality traits allow them to flexibly adapt to their changing environment in ways that lead to more healthy relationships with others and better coping strategies. When people have personality traits that are less adaptive, this leads to inflexibility and unhealthy coping. For example, they may manage stress by drinking or misusing drugs, have a hard time managing their anger, and find it hard to trust and connect with others. Personality forms early in life. It is shaped through a blend of your: A personality disorder is a mental health condition where people have a lifelong pattern of seeing themselves and reacting to others in ways that cause problems. People with personality disorders often have a hard time understanding emotions and tolerating distress. And they act impulsively. This makes it hard for them to relate to others, causing serious issues, and affecting their family life, social activities, work and school performance, and overall quality of life.\", 'Symptoms': \"In some cases, you may not know that you have a personality disorder. That's because how you think and behave seems natural to you. You also may think others are responsible for your challenges. There are many types of personality disorders, each with important differences. These disorders are organized into three groups, or clusters, with shared features and symptoms:\", 'Causes': \"It's believed that personality disorders are caused by a blend of how genetics and your environment affect you.

It can happen if body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher. Heatstroke is most common in the summer months. Heatstroke needs emergency care. If it's not treated, heatstroke can quickly damage the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. This damage gets worse the longer treatment is delayed, which increases the risk of serious complications or death.\", 'Symptoms': 'Heatstroke symptoms include:', 'Causes': 'Heatstroke can happen as a result of: In either type of heatstroke, your condition can be brought on by:'}\n",

Infections can reach a bone through the bloodstream or from nearby infected tissue. Infections also can begin in the bone if an injury opens the bone to germs. People who smoke and people with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or kidney failure, are at higher risk of getting osteomyelitis. People who have diabetes with foot ulcers may get osteomyelitis in the bones of their feet. Most people with osteomyelitis need surgery to remove areas of the affected bone.

It can occur at any age but usually affects children and teenagers after a viral infection, most commonly the flu or chickenpox. Reye's syndrome is rare. The condition also is known as Reye syndrome. Symptoms such as confusion, seizures and loss of consciousness need emergency treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of Reye's syndrome can save a child's life. Aspirin has been linked with Reye's syndrome in children or teenagers who have the flu or chickenpox. Do not give children or teenagers aspirin. To treat fever or pain, consider giving your child infants' or children's acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). Infants' or children's acetaminophen and ibuprofen medicines are safer alternatives to aspirin. Talk to your healthcare professional if you have concerns.\", 'Symptoms': \"The symptoms of Reye's syndrome usually start about 3 to 5 days after a viral infection begins. The viral infection may be the flu, also known as influenza, or chickenpox. Or Reye's syndrome may develop after an upper respiratory infection such as a cold. In Reye's syndrome, a child's blood sugar usually drops while levels of ammonia and acidity in the blood rise. The liver also may swell, and fats may build up. Swelling may occur in the brain. This can cause seizures, convulsions or loss of consciousness.\", 'Causes': \"The exact cause of Reye's syndrome is not known. The use of aspirin during a viral illness has most commonly been linked to Reye's syndrome. Several factors may play a role. In some children, the symptoms of Reye's syndrome may be caused by another health condition, such as a metabolic condition. This can occur even without the use of aspirin. Metabolic conditions are rare. The most common condition that causes Reye's syndrome is medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. In MCAD deficiency, the body can't break down certain fats to turn them into energy. This happens because an enzyme is missing or not working properly. MCAD deficiency is a fatty acid oxidation disorder. In people with a fatty acid oxidation disorder, aspirin use during a viral illness is more likely to trigger symptoms of Reye's syndrome. A screening test can determine if your child has a fatty acid oxidation disorder. Reye's syndrome may develop after influenza or chickenpox in particular. Exposure to certain toxins — such as insecticides, herbicides and paint thinner — may produce symptoms similar to Reye's syndrome. But these toxins don't cause Reye's syndrome.\"}\n",

These tumors are not cancer. Noncancerous tumors, also called benign tumors, are overgrowths of cells and tissue that are not expected. Symptoms vary widely, depending on where the growths develop and how big they get. Tuberous sclerosis is often first found during infancy or childhood. Sometimes tuberous sclerosis can have such mild symptoms that the condition isn't diagnosed until adulthood, or it's not diagnosed at all. Sometimes tuberous sclerosis causes serious disabilities. There is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, and the course of the disorder and how bad it gets can't be predicted. But treatments are available to manage symptoms.\", 'Symptoms': 'Tuberous sclerosis symptoms are caused by noncancerous growths in parts of the body, most commonly in the skin, brain, eyes, kidneys, heart and lungs.

Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include:', 'Causes': 'Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder caused by gene changes — sometimes called mutations — in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene. These genes are thought to prevent cells from growing too fast or in an out-of-control way. Changes in either of these genes can cause cells to grow and divide more than needed. This leads to multiple growths throughout the body. These growths are considered noncancerous tumors.'}\n"

Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if you've had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic disorder. Although panic attacks themselves aren't life-threatening, they can be frightening and significantly affect your quality of life. But treatment can be very effective.\", 'Symptoms': \"Panic attacks typically begin suddenly, without warning. They can strike at any time — when you're driving a car, at the mall, sound asleep or in the middle of a business meeting. You may have occasional panic attacks, or they may occur frequently. Panic attacks have many variations, but symptoms usually peak within minutes. You may feel fatigued and worn out after a panic attack subsides.

Some research suggests that your body's natural fight-or-flight response to danger is involved in panic attacks. For example, if a grizzly bear came after you, your body would react instinctively. Your heart rate and breathing would speed up as your body prepared for a life-threatening situation. Many of the same reactions occur in a panic attack.

Ataxia can be a symptom of several nervous system conditions. Symptoms may include:', 'Causes': 'Ataxia is caused by damage to the part of the brain called the cerebellum or its connections. The cerebellum is located at the base of the brain and connects to the brainstem. The cerebellum helps control balance, eye movements, swallowing and speech. There are three major groups of ataxia causes: acquired, degenerative and hereditary. Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are passed down in families. These conditions also are called hereditary. If you have one of these conditions, you may have been born with a genetic change that causes the body to make irregular proteins. The irregular proteins affect the function of nerve cells, primarily in the cerebellum and spinal cord. They cause the nerve cells to break down and die, known as degeneration. As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen. People with a genetic ataxia may have inherited a dominant gene from one parent, known as an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Or they may have inherited a recessive gene from both parents, known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In a recessive condition, the parents are not affected but siblings may be affected. Different gene changes cause different types of ataxia. Most types get worse over time.

In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. This part is called the stomach body. In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus. Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. Other treatments may be used before and after surgery. Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. Many can expect to be cured. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure.\", 'Symptoms': \"Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include: Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages. When they happen, symptoms might include indigestion and pain in the upper part of the belly. Symptoms might not happen until the cancer is advanced. Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools. Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. The belly might look swollen.\", 'Causes': \"It's not clear what causes stomach cancer. Experts believe most stomach cancers start when something hurts the inside lining of the stomach. Examples include having an infection in the stomach, having long-standing acid reflux and eating a lot of salty foods. Not everyone with these risk factors gets stomach cancer, though. So more research is needed to find out exactly what causes it. Stomach cancer begins when something hurts cells in the inner lining of the stomach. It causes the cells to develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The cells can go on living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural lifecycle. This causes a lot of extra cells in the stomach. The cells can form a mass called a tumor. Cancer cells in the stomach can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. They might start to grow deeper into the wall of the stomach. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer cells spread to another part of the body it's called metastasis.\"}\n",

Brain tumors also can happen near the brain tissue. Nearby locations include nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain. Brain tumors can begin in the brain. These are called primary brain tumors. Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors. Many different types of primary brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous brain tumors or benign brain tumors. Noncancerous brain tumors may grow over time and press on the brain tissue. Other brain tumors are brain cancers, also called malignant brain tumors. Brain cancers may grow quickly. The cancer cells can invade and destroy the brain tissue. Brain tumors range in size from very small to very large. Some brain tumors are found when they are very small because they cause symptoms that you notice right away. Other brain tumors grow very large before they're found. Some parts of the brain are less active than others. If a brain tumor starts in a part of the brain that's less active, it might not cause symptoms right away. The brain tumor size could become quite large before the tumor is detected. Brain tumor treatment options depend on the type of brain tumor you have, as well as its size and location. Common treatments include surgery and radiation therapy.\", 'Symptoms': \"The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location.

In one form of pulmonary hypertension, called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), blood vessels in the lungs are narrowed, blocked or destroyed. The damage slows blood flow through the lungs. Blood pressure in the lung arteries goes up. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs. The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail. In some people, pulmonary hypertension slowly gets worse and can be life-threatening. There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatments are available to help you feel better, live longer and improve your quality of life.\", 'Symptoms': 'The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension develop slowly.

Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: Shortness of breath is the most common symptom of pulmonary hypertension. But it may be caused by other health conditions such as asthma. See a health care professional for an accurate diagnosis.', 'Causes': 'The typical heart has two upper chambers and two lower chambers. Each time blood moves through the heart, the lower right chamber pumps blood to the lungs. The blood passes through a large blood vessel called the pulmonary artery. Blood usually flows easily through blood vessels in the lungs to the left side of the heart. These blood vessels are the pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins. But changes in the cells that line the lung arteries can cause the artery walls to become narrow, stiff, swollen and thick. These changes may slow down or stop blood flow through the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause.'}\n",

Lymphedema can be caused by cancer treatments that remove or damage your lymph nodes. Any type of problem that blocks the drainage of lymph fluid can cause lymphedema. Severe cases of lymphedema can affect the ability to move the affected limb, increase the risks of skin infections and sepsis, and can lead to skin changes and breakdown. Treatment may include compression bandages, massage, compression stockings, sequential pneumatic pumping, careful skin care and, rarely, surgery to remove swollen tissue or to create new drainage routes.\", 'Symptoms': 'Lymphedema signs and symptoms include: Signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Lymphedema caused by cancer treatment may not occur until months or years after treatment.', 'Causes': \"The lymphatic system is a network of vessels that carry protein-rich lymph fluid throughout the body.

But not everyone with mesothelioma has been around asbestos. Exactly what causes the cancer may not be known. Mesothelioma is a cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the mesothelium. The mesothelium is a thin layer of tissue that covers many internal organs. Mesothelioma happens when cells in the mesothelium develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give other instructions. The DNA changes tell the cancer cells to make more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.\"}\n",

Various things can cause esophagitis. Some common causes include stomach acids backing up into the esophagus, infection, medicines taken by mouth and allergies. Treatment for esophagitis depends on its exact cause and how badly the tissue that lines the esophagus is damaged. Without treatment, esophagitis can damage this lining.

      "{'disease': 'Atrial fibrillation', 'Overview': \"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.\", 'Symptoms': \"Symptoms of AFib may include: Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms. Atrial fibrillation may be:\", 'Causes': 'To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats. The heart has four chambers: Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat. The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers. In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute. But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. The AV node is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm. In people with AFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute.'}\n",

PKU is caused by a change in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. This gene helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine. Without the enzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine, a dangerous buildup can develop when a person with PKU eats foods that contain protein or eats aspartame, an artificial sweetener. This can eventually lead to serious health problems. For the rest of their lives, people with PKU — babies, children and adults — need to follow a diet that limits phenylalanine, which is found mostly in foods that contain protein. Newer medications may allow some people with PKU to eat a diet that has a higher or an unrestricted amount of phenylalanine. Babies in the United States and many other countries are screened for PKU soon after birth. Although there is no cure for PKU, recognizing PKU and starting treatment right away can help prevent limitations in areas of thinking, understanding and communicating (intellectual disability) and major health problems.', 'Symptoms': \"Newborns with PKU initially don't have any symptoms.

Other reactions, particularly rashes, can happen hours, days or weeks later. Drug allergy symptoms may include:', 'Causes': \"A drug allergy happens when the immune system mistakenly identifies a medicine as a harmful substance, such as a virus or bacterium. Once the immune system detects a medicine as a harmful substance, it develops an antibody specific to that medicine. This can happen the first time you take a medicine, but sometimes an allergy doesn't develop until there have been repeated exposures. The next time you take the medicine, these specific antibodies flag the medicine and direct immune system attacks on the substance. Chemicals released by this activity cause the symptoms associated with an allergic reaction. You may not be aware of your first exposure to a medicine, however. Some evidence suggests that trace amounts of a medicine in the food supply, such as an antibiotic, may be enough for the immune system to create an antibody to it. Some allergic reactions may result from a somewhat different process. Researchers believe that some medicines can bind directly to a certain type of immune system white blood cell called a T cell.

It causes the death of nerve cells in the brain, known as degeneration. CTE gets worse over time. The only way to definitively diagnosis CTE is after death during an autopsy of the brain. CTE is a rare disorder that is not yet well understood. CTE doesn't appear to be related to a single head injury. It's related to repeated head injuries, often occurring in contact sports or military combat. The development of CTE has been associated with second impact syndrome, in which a second head injury happens before previous head injury symptoms have fully resolved. Experts are still trying to understand how repeated head injuries and other factors might contribute to the changes in the brain that result in CTE. Researchers are looking into how the number of head injuries someone experiences and how bad the injuries are may affect risk of CTE. CTE has been found in the brains of people who played U.S. football and other contact sports, including boxing. It also may occur in military members who were exposed to explosive blasts. Symptoms of CTE are thought to include trouble with thinking and emotions, physical problems, and other behaviors. It's thought that these develop years to decades after head trauma occurs. CTE can't be definitively diagnosed during life except in people with high-risk exposures. Researchers are currently developing diagnostic biomarkers for CTE, but none has been validated yet.

In the people who were confirmed to have CTE at autopsy, symptoms have included cognitive, behavioral, mood and motor changes.', 'Causes': \"Repeated head trauma is likely the cause of CTE. Football players in the United States, ice hockey players and military members serving in war zones have been the focus of most CTE studies. However, other sports and factors such as physical abuse also can lead to repeated head injuries. A head injury can cause a concussion, which may cause headaches, problems with memory and other symptoms. Not everyone who experiences repeated concussions, including athletes and military members, go on to develop CTE. Some studies have shown no increased incidence of CTE in people exposed to repeated head injuries. In brains with CTE, researchers have found that there is a buildup of a protein called tau around the blood vessels. Tau buildup in CTE is different from accumulations of tau found in Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. CTE is thought to cause areas of the brain to waste away, known as atrophy. This happens because injuries to nerve cells that conduct electrical impulses affect communication between cells. It's possible that people with CTE may show signs of another neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, also known as frontotemporal dementia.\"}\n",

A spasm in your diaphragm causes your vocal cords to suddenly close, producing a \"hic\" sound. Eating a large meal, drinking alcoholic or carbonated beverages, or getting excited suddenly may cause hiccups. In some cases, hiccups may be a sign of an underlying medical issue. For most people, hiccups usually last only a few minutes. Rarely, hiccups may continue for months. When they last that long, they can result in weight loss and extreme tiredness.', 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms include uncontrolled spasms in your diaphragm and a \"hic\" sound. Sometimes you may feel a slight tightening sensation in your chest, stomach area or throat.', 'Causes': 'The most common triggers for hiccups that last less than 48 hours include: Issues that may cause hiccups to last more than 48 hours include nerve damage or irritation, central nervous system disorders, metabolic issues, and certain drug and alcohol problems.'}\n",
      "{'disease': 'IgA nephropathy (Berger disease)', 'Overview': \"IgA nephropathy (nuh-FROP-uh-thee), also known as Berger disease, is a kidney disease. It happens when a germ-fighting protein called immunoglobulin A (IgA) builds up in the kidneys. This causes a type of swelling called inflammation that, over time, can make it harder for the kidneys to filter waste from the blood. IgA nephropathy often becomes worse slowly over years. But the course of the disease varies from person to person. Some people leak blood into their urine without having other problems. Others might have complications such as losing kidney function and spilling protein into the urine. Still others develop kidney failure, which means the kidneys stop working well enough to filter the body's waste on their own. There's no cure for IgA nephropathy, but medicines can slow how quickly it becomes worse. Some people need treatment to lower inflammation, reduce the spilling of protein into the urine and prevent the kidneys from failing. Such treatments may help the disease become not active, a state called remission. Keeping blood pressure under control and lowering cholesterol also slow the disease.\", 'Symptoms': \"IgA nephropathy often doesn't cause symptoms early on. You might not notice any health effects for 10 years or more. Sometimes, routine medical tests find signs of the disease, such as protein and red blood cells in the urine that are seen under a microscope. When IgA nephropathy causes symptoms, they might include: If the disease leads to kidney failure, symptoms may include: Kidney failure is life-threatening without treatment. But dialysis or a kidney transplant can help people live for many more years.\", 'Causes': \"The kidneys are two bean-shaped, fist-sized organs located at the small of the back, one on each side of the spine. Each kidney contains tiny blood vessels called glomeruli. These vessels filter waste, extra water and other substances from the blood. Then the filtered blood goes back into the bloodstream. The waste products pass into the bladder and out of the body in urine. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a type of protein called an antibody. The immune system makes IgA to help attack germs and fight infections. But with IgA nephropathy, this protein collects in the glomeruli. This causes inflammation and affects their filtering ability over time. Researchers don't know exactly what causes IgA to build up in the kidneys. But the following things might be linked with it:\"}\n",

Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made. The word \"acute\" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. It\\'s called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

Myeloid cells are bone marrow cells that can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. Healthy myeloid cells can become: Every cell in the body contains DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. But when the DNA changes happen in the myeloid cells, the changes give different instructions. The myeloid cells start to make a lot of extra cells, and they don't stop. The DNA changes cause the myeloid cells to make a lot of immature white blood cells, called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts don't work right. They can build up in the bone marrow. They can crowd out healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, there might be low oxygen levels in the blood, easy bruising and bleeding, and frequent infections.\"}\n",

But other cancers can happen in the head and neck and are sometimes considered part of this category too. Head and neck cancer isn't a diagnosis. Instead, it's a category of cancers that have some things in common. For example, many head and neck cancers share some risk factors and treatments. Most head and neck cancers begin in squamous cells. These thin, flat cells make up the outer layer of the skin. They also line the inside of the nose, mouth and throat. Cancers that begin in the squamous cells are called squamous cell carcinomas. Cancers can begin in other kinds of cells in the head and neck area, though these are less common.

That includes relieving thirst, lowering the amount of urine the body makes and preventing dehydration.', 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of diabetes insipidus in adults include: Adults typically urinate an average of 1 to 3 quarts (about 1 to 3 liters) a day. People who have diabetes insipidus and who drink a lot of fluids may make as much as 20 quarts (about 19 liters) of urine a day. A baby or young child who has diabetes insipidus may have these symptoms:', 'Causes': \"Diabetes insipidus happens when the body can't balance its fluid levels in a healthy way. Fluid in the blood is filtered through the kidneys to remove waste. Afterward, most of that fluid is returned to the bloodstream. The waste and a small amount of fluid leave the kidneys as urine. Urine leaves the body after it's temporarily stored in the bladder. A hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) — also called vasopressin — is needed to get the fluid that's filtered by the kidneys back into the bloodstream. ADH is made in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It's then stored in the pituitary gland, a small gland found at the base of the brain. Conditions that cause the brain to make too little ADH or disorders that block the effect of ADH cause the body to make too much urine. In diabetes insipidus, the body can't properly balance fluid levels. The cause of the fluid imbalance depends on the type of diabetes insipidus. Sometimes no clear cause of diabetes insipidus can be found. In that case, repeat testing over time often is useful. Testing may be able to identify an underlying cause eventually.\"}\n",

When you become sexually aroused, more blood flows to these chambers. As the chambers fill with blood, the penis expands, straightens and stiffens into an erection. In Peyronie disease, when the penis becomes erect, the area with the scar tissue doesn't stretch. As a result, the penis bends or goes through other changes. This can be painful. In most people, Peyronie disease symptoms come on slowly and don't seem to be linked with an injury. Researchers are looking into whether Peyronie disease might be tied to a genetic trait or certain health conditions.\"}\n",

Health care providers have ways to clear out the infection. They also can treat any medical problem that might be causing it. Peritonitis treatment usually involves medicines that are used for infections caused by bacteria, called antibiotics. Some people with peritonitis need surgery. If you don't get treatment, peritonitis can lead to a serious infection that spreads through the body. It can be deadly. A common cause of peritonitis is a treatment for kidney failure called peritoneal dialysis. This treatment helps get rid of waste products from the blood when the kidneys struggle to do that job themselves. If you get peritoneal dialysis, you can help prevent peritonitis with good hygiene before, during and after dialysis. For example, it's important to wash your hands and clean the skin around your catheter.\", 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of peritonitis include: If you get peritoneal dialysis, peritonitis symptoms also may include:', 'Causes': \"Peritoneum infection is usually caused by a hole in an organ in the abdomen, such as the stomach and colon. The hole is also called a rupture. It's rare for peritonitis to happen for other causes. Common causes of a hole that leads to peritonitis include: Peritonitis that happens without a hole or tear is called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Also called congenital talipes equinovarus (TAL-ih-peez e-kwie-no-VAY-rus), clubfoot is a common foot condition. It can occur in up to 1 in 1,000 babies. Most newborns with clubfoot do not have other medical conditions. Clubfoot can be mild to severe. About half of children with clubfoot have it in both feet. If a child has clubfoot that is not treated, the child may walk on the side or top of the foot. This can cause a limp, skin sores or calluses, and problems wearing shoes. Clubfoot will not get better without treatment. But it can be successfully treated using a specific casting technique. Usually, babies also need a minor procedure to lengthen the heel tendon.

You may experience distress at the thought of getting rid of the items. You gradually keep or gather a huge number of items, regardless of their actual value. Hoarding often creates extremely cramped living conditions with only narrow pathways winding through stacks of clutter. Countertops, sinks, stoves, desks, stairways and all other surfaces are usually piled with stuff. You may not be able to use some areas for their intended purpose. For example, you may not be able to cook in the kitchen. When there's no more room inside your home, the clutter may spread to the garage, vehicles, yard and other storage areas. Hoarding ranges from mild to severe. In some cases, hoarding may not have much impact on your life, while in other cases it seriously affects your daily functioning. People with hoarding disorder may not see it as a problem, so getting them to take part in treatment can be challenging. But intensive treatment can help you understand how your beliefs and behaviors can be changed so that you can live a safer, more enjoyable life.\", 'Symptoms': \"The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things.

By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat. Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include: Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in: With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because: Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder.\", 'Causes': \"It's not clear what causes hoarding disorder.

      "{'disease': 'Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin', 'Overview': \"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells on the skin. It starts in cells called squamous cells. The squamous cells make up the middle and outer layers of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is usually not life-threatening. But if it's not treated, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can grow large or spread to other parts of the body. The growth of the cancer can cause serious complications. Most squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are caused by too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation comes either from sunlight or from tanning beds or lamps. Protecting your skin from UV light can help reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and other forms of skin cancer. Squamous cell carcinomas can be anywhere on the skin. In people who sunburn easily, the cancer is usually found on areas of skin that have had a lot of sun. In people with Black and brown skin, squamous cell carcinomas are more likely to be on skin that isn't exposed to sun, such as the genitals.\", 'Symptoms': \"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin most often occurs on sun-exposed skin. This includes the scalp, the backs of the hands, the ears or the lips. But it can occur anywhere on the body. It can even occur inside the mouth, on the bottoms of the feet or on the genitals. When squamous cell carcinoma of the skin happens in people with Black and brown skin, it tends to happen in places that aren't exposed to the sun. Symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin include:\", 'Causes': \"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin occurs when the squamous cells in the skin get changes in their DNA. Cells' DNA holds the instructions that tell cells what to do. The changes tell the squamous cells to multiply quickly. The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. This causes too many cells. The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes most of the DNA changes in skin cells. UV radiation can come from sunlight, tanning lamps and tanning beds. But skin cancers also can grow on skin that's not usually in sunlight. This means that other factors might add to the risk of skin cancer. One such factor might be having a condition that weakens the immune system.\"}\n",

OCA is a group of disorders passed down in families where the body makes little or none of a substance called melanin. The type and amount of melanin in your body determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Melanin also plays a role in the development and function of the eyes, so people with albinism have vision problems. Symptoms of albinism are usually seen in a person's skin, hair and eye color, but sometimes differences are slight. People with albinism are also sensitive to the effects of the sun, so they're at higher risk of getting skin cancer. Although there's no cure for albinism, people with the disorder can take steps to protect their skin and eyes and get proper eye and skin care.\", 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.', 'Causes': 'Several genes give instructions for making one of several proteins involved in producing melanin. Melanin is made by cells called melanocytes that are found in your skin, hair and eyes. Albinism is caused by a change in one of these genes. Different types of albinism can occur, based mainly on which gene change caused the disorder. The gene change may result in no melanin at all or a big decrease in the amount of melanin.'}\n",

It previously was called primary biliary cirrhosis. Bile is a fluid made in the liver. It helps with digestion and absorbing certain vitamins. It also helps the body absorb fats and get rid of cholesterol, toxins and worn-out red blood cells. Ongoing inflammation in the liver can lead to bile duct inflammation and damage known as cholangitis. At times, this can lead to permanent scarring of liver tissue, called cirrhosis. It also can eventually lead to liver failure. Although it affects both sexes, primary biliary cholangitis mostly affects women. It's considered an autoimmune disease, which means your body's immune system is mistakenly attacking healthy cells and tissue. Researchers think a combination of genetic and environmental factors triggers the disease. It usually develops slowly. At this time, there's no cure for primary biliary cholangitis, but medicines may slow liver damage, especially if treatment begins early.\", 'Symptoms': 'More than half of people with primary biliary cholangitis do not have any noticeable symptoms when diagnosed. The disease may be diagnosed when blood tests are done for other reasons, such as routine testing. Symptoms eventually develop over the next 5 to 20 years. Those who do have symptoms at diagnosis typically have poorer outcomes. Common early symptoms include: Later signs and symptoms may include:', 'Causes': \"It's not clear what causes primary biliary cholangitis. Many experts consider it an autoimmune disease in which the body turns against its own cells. Researchers believe this autoimmune response may be triggered by environmental and genetic factors. The liver inflammation seen in primary biliary cholangitis starts when certain types of white blood cells called T cells, also known as T lymphocytes, start to collect in the liver. Usually, these immune cells detect and help defend against germs, such as bacteria and viruses. But in primary biliary cholangitis, they mistakenly destroy the healthy cells that line the small bile ducts in the liver. Inflammation in the smallest ducts spreads and eventually damages other cells in the liver. As the cells die, they're replaced by scar tissue, also known as fibrosis, that can lead to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is scarring of liver tissue that makes it difficult for your liver to work properly.\"}\n",

The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch that sticks out from the colon on the lower right side of the belly, also called the abdomen. Appendicitis causes pain in the lower right part of the belly. However, in most people, pain begins around the belly button and then moves. As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes serious. Although anyone can develop appendicitis, most often it happens in people between the ages of 10 and 30. Treatment of appendicitis is usually antibiotics and, in most instances, surgery to remove the appendix.', 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of appendicitis may include: The site of the pain may vary, depending on age and the position of the appendix. In pregnancy, the pain may seem to come from the upper belly because the appendix is higher during pregnancy.', 'Causes': 'A blockage in the lining of the appendix, called the lumen, is the likely cause of appendicitis. This blockage can cause an infection. The bacteria then multiply quickly, causing the appendix to become inflamed, swollen and filled with pus. If not treated right away, the appendix may burst or break open.'}\n",

This condition also is called overactive thyroid. Hyperthyroidism speeds up the body's metabolism. That can cause many symptoms, such as weight loss, hand tremors, and rapid or irregular heartbeat. Several treatments are available for hyperthyroidism. Anti-thyroid medicines and radioiodine can be used to slow the amount of hormones the thyroid gland makes. Sometimes, hyperthyroidism treatment includes surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. In some cases, depending on what's causing it, hyperthyroidism may improve without medication or other treatment.\", 'Symptoms': 'Hyperthyroidism sometimes looks like other health problems. That can make it hard to diagnose. It can cause many symptoms, including: Older adults are more likely to have symptoms that are hard to notice. These symptoms may include an irregular heartbeat, weight loss, depression, and feeling weak or tired during ordinary activities.', 'Causes': 'Hyperthyroidism can be caused by several medical conditions that affect the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck. It has a big impact on the body. Every part of metabolism is controlled by hormones that the thyroid gland makes. The thyroid gland produces two main hormones: thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). These hormones affect every cell in the body. They support the rate at which the body uses fats and carbohydrates. They help control body temperature. They have an effect on heart rate. And they help control how much protein the body makes. Hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland puts too much of those thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. Conditions that can lead to hyperthyroidism include:'}\n",

Your voice box sits just below your throat and also is susceptible to throat cancer. The voice box is made of cartilage and contains the vocal cords that vibrate to make sound when you talk.', 'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms of throat cancer may include:', 'Causes': \"Throat cancer occurs when cells in your throat develop genetic mutations. These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and continue living after healthy cells would normally die. The accumulating cells can form a tumor in your throat.

It can pass from soil and water to plants, animals and humans. Once the parasite has a new host, the reproduction cycle goes on and causes an infection. If you're in typical health, your immune system keeps the parasites in check. They stay in your body but are not active. This often gives you lifelong immunity. If you're exposed to the parasite again, your immune system would clear it out. If your immune system is weakened later in life, parasite reproduction can start again.

This mutation can increase your chance of developing abnormal blood clots, most commonly in your legs or lungs. Most people with factor V Leiden never develop abnormal clots. But in people who do, these abnormal clots can lead to long-term health problems or become life-threatening. Both men and women can have factor V Leiden. Women who carry the factor V Leiden mutation may have an increased tendency to develop blood clots during pregnancy or when taking the hormone estrogen. If you have factor V Leiden and have developed blood clots, anticoagulant medications can lessen your risk of developing additional blood clots and help you avoid potentially serious complications.', 'Symptoms': 'The factor V Leiden mutation does not itself cause any symptoms. Since factor V Leiden is a risk for developing blood clots in the leg or lungs, the first indication that you have the disorder may be the development of an abnormal blood clot. Some clots do no damage and disappear on their own. Others can be life-threatening. Symptoms of a blood clot depend on what part of your body is affected.', 'Causes': 'If you have factor V Leiden, you inherited either one copy or, rarely, two copies of the defective gene. Inheriting one copy slightly increases your risk of developing blood clots. Inheriting two copies — one from each parent — significantly increases your risk of developing blood clots.'}\n",

But in babies with cleft lip and cleft palate, they never come together or only come together partway, leaving an opening. Both genes and the environment may cause cases of cleft lip and cleft palate. But in many babies, the cause is not known. The mother or the father can pass on genes that cause clefting, either alone or as part of a genetic syndrome that includes a cleft lip or cleft palate as one of its signs.

The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid usually flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column. But the pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid can damage brain tissues and cause a range of symptoms related to brain function. Hydrocephalus can happen at any age, but it occurs more often among infants and among adults 60 and older. Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain. Therapies can manage symptoms resulting from hydrocephalus.', 'Symptoms': 'The symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary by age.', 'Causes': \"Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between how much cerebrospinal fluid is produced and how much is absorbed into the bloodstream. Tissues lining the ventricles of the brain produce cerebrospinal fluid. It flows through the ventricles by way of channels. The fluid eventually flows into spaces around the brain and spinal column. It's absorbed primarily by blood vessels in tissues on the surface of the brain.

The pituitary gland is a kidney-bean-sized gland at the base of your brain. It is part of the body's system of glands that make hormones, called the endocrine system. The pituitary gland makes several hormones. They act on nearly every part of the body. Hypopituitarism is when there isn't enough of one or more of the pituitary hormones. This lack of hormones, called a deficiency, can affect how the body works in many ways. These include growth, blood pressure and the ability to have children, among others. Symptoms depend on which hormones are missing. People who have hypopituitarism usually need to take medicines for the rest of their lives. These medicines replace the missing hormones, which helps control symptoms.\", 'Symptoms': \"The symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time. They might not be noticed for months or even years. But for some people, symptoms start suddenly. Symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person. Symptoms depend on what hormones are missing and how little of the hormone is being made. There might be more than one hormone that's low. A second hormone deficiency might increase the symptoms of the first one. Or sometimes, it might hide those symptoms.\", 'Causes': \"Hypopituitarism has a number of causes. One common cause is a tumor of the pituitary gland. As a pituitary tumor grows, it can press on and damage pituitary tissue. This disrupts the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. A tumor also can press on the optic nerves, causing vision problems. Other potential causes of damage to the pituitary gland that may lead to hypopituitarism include: In some cases, a change in a gene causes hypopituitarism. That change is heredity, which means it is passed down in families. The genetic change affects the pituitary gland's ability to make one or more of its hormones. This often starts at birth or in early childhood. Tumors or diseases of a part of the brain that's just above the pituitary, called the hypothalamus, also can cause hypopituitarism. The hypothalamus makes hormones that affect how the pituitary gland works. Sometimes, the cause of hypopituitarism isn't known.\"}\n",

Often, a person who is red-green or blue-yellow deficient isn't completely insensitive to both colors. Defects can be mild, moderate or severe.\", 'Causes': \"Seeing colors across the light spectrum is a complex process that begins with your eyes' ability to respond to different wavelengths of light. Light, which contains all color wavelengths, enters your eye through the cornea and passes through the lens and transparent, jellylike tissue in your eye (vitreous humor) to wavelength-sensitive cells (cones) at the back of your eye in the macular area of the retina. The cones are sensitive to short (blue), medium (green) or long (red) wavelengths of light. Chemicals in the cones trigger a reaction and send the wavelength information through your optic nerve to your brain. If your eyes work as they should, you perceive color. But if your cones don't work properly, you will be unable to distinguish the colors red, green or blue.\"}\n",

Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months.\", 'Causes': \"Inflammatory breast cancer happens when cells in the breast develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. Most often the DNA changes happen in a cell in one of the tubes, called ducts, that can carry breast milk to the nipple. But the cancer also can begin with a cell in the glandular tissue, called lobules, where breast milk can be produced. In inflammatory breast cancer, the cancer cells break away from where they started. They travel to the lymphatic vessels in the breast skin. The cells grow to clog the vessels. The blockage in the lymphatic vessels causes skin color changes, swelling and dimpled skin. This skin is a classic sign of inflammatory breast cancer.\"}\n",

In addition, snoring can be a nuisance to your partner. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol close to bedtime or sleeping on your side, can help stop snoring. In addition, medical devices and surgery are available that may reduce disruptive snoring. However, these aren't suitable or necessary for everyone who snores.\", 'Symptoms': 'Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not all snorers have OSA, but if snoring is accompanied by any of the following symptoms, it may be an indication to see a doctor for further evaluation for OSA: OSA often is characterized by loud snoring followed by periods of silence when breathing stops or nearly stops. Eventually, this reduction or pause in breathing may signal you to wake up, and you may awaken with a loud snort or gasping sound. You may sleep lightly due to disrupted sleep. This pattern of breathing pauses may be repeated many times during the night. People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep.', 'Causes': 'Snoring can be caused by a number of factors, such as the anatomy of your mouth and sinuses, alcohol consumption, allergies, a cold, and your weight. When you doze off and progress from a light sleep to a deep sleep, the muscles in the roof of your mouth (soft palate), tongue and throat relax. The tissues in your throat can relax enough that they partially block your airway and vibrate. The more narrowed your airway, the more forceful the airflow becomes.

HHT affects the way blood vessels form in several areas of the body, including the brain. Typically, the heart sends oxygen-rich blood to the brain through arteries. The arteries slow blood flow by passing the blood through a series of smaller and smaller blood vessels. The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries. The capillaries slowly deliver oxygen through their thin, porous walls to the surrounding brain tissue. The oxygen-depleted blood passes into small blood vessels and then into larger veins. The veins return the blood to the heart and lungs to get more oxygen. The arteries and veins in an AVM lack this supporting network of smaller blood vessels and capillaries.

In contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults. Signs and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant: For children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations. Performance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations. Physical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include: Common, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including: Social anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment. See your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.\", 'Causes': 'Like many other mental health conditions, social anxiety disorder likely arises from a complex interaction of biological and environmental factors.

When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism. But in adulthood, a change in height doesn't occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of your hands, feet and face, and is called acromegaly. Because acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. Untreated, high levels of growth hormone can affect other parts of the body, in addition to your bones. This can lead to serious — sometimes even life-threatening — health problems. But treatment can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features.\", 'Symptoms': \"A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following:\", 'Causes': 'Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. It produces GH and a number of other hormones. GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth. When the pituitary gland releases GH into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) — sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I. IGF-1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH leads to too much IGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications. In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production:'}\n",

If left untreated, MCAD deficiency may lead to severe lack of energy and tiredness, liver disease, coma, and other serious health problems. Also, the level of sugar in your blood can drop dangerously low — a condition called hypoglycemia. Prevention and prompt treatment are essential regardless of blood sugar level. If you have MCAD deficiency, a sudden episode, called a metabolic crisis, can be caused by common illnesses, high fever, stomach problems or going too long without eating, known as prolonged fasting. MCAD deficiency is present from birth and is a lifelong condition. In the United States, all states test for MCAD deficiency at birth as part of newborn screening. Many other countries also provide routine newborn screening for MCAD deficiency. If MCAD deficiency is diagnosed and treated early, the disorder can be well managed through diet and lifestyle.', 'Symptoms': 'MCAD deficiency is usually first identified in babies and young children.

They may include: A sudden severe episode, called a metabolic crisis, can be due to:', 'Causes': \"When you don't have enough of the MCAD enzyme in your body, certain fats called medium-chain fatty acids can't be broken down and turned into energy. This leads to low energy and low blood sugar. Also, fatty acids can build up in body tissues and cause damage. MCAD deficiency is caused by a change in the ACADM gene. The condition is inherited from both parents in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both parents are carriers — each has one changed gene and one unchanged gene — but they don't have symptoms of the condition. The child with MCAD deficiency inherits two copies of the changed gene — one from each parent. If you inherit only one changed gene, you won't develop MCAD deficiency.

Before birth, there is a temporary opening called the ductus arteriosus between the two main blood vessels leaving a baby's heart. Those vessels are the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The opening is needed for a baby's blood flow before birth. It moves blood away from a baby's lungs while they develop. The baby gets oxygen from the mother's blood. After birth, the ductus arteriosus is no longer needed. It usually closes within 2 to 3 days. But in some infants, the opening doesn't close. When it stays open, it's called a patent ductus arteriosus. The constant opening causes too much blood to flow to the baby's lungs and heart. Untreated, the blood pressure in the baby's lungs might increase. The baby's heart might grow larger and get weak.\"}\n",

Chiari malformation type 2 is nearly always associated with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele. When the cerebellum is pushed into the upper spinal canal, it can interfere with the usual flow of cerebrospinal fluid that protects the brain and spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid can build up in the brain or spinal cord. Or it can cause signals transmitted from the brain to the body to be blocked.

Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. It's known as a chronic pain condition. People with trigeminal neuralgia may at first experience short, mild episodes of pain. But the condition can get worse, causing longer periods of pain that happen more often. It's more common in women and people older than 50. But trigeminal neuralgia, also known as tic douloureux, doesn't mean living a life of pain. It usually can be managed with treatment.\", 'Symptoms': 'Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns:', 'Causes': \"In trigeminal neuralgia, the trigeminal nerve's function is disrupted. Contact between a blood vessel and the trigeminal nerve at the base of the brain often causes the pain. The blood vessel may be an artery or a vein. This contact puts pressure on the nerve and doesn't allow it to function as usual. But while compression by a blood vessel is a common cause, there are many other potential causes. Multiple sclerosis or a similar condition that damages the myelin sheath protecting certain nerves can cause trigeminal neuralgia. A tumor pressing against the trigeminal nerve also can cause the condition. Some people may experience trigeminal neuralgia as a result of a stroke or facial trauma. An injury of the nerve due to surgery also can cause trigeminal neuralgia.\"}\n",

Brain growth continues, giving the head a misshapen appearance. Usually, during infancy the sutures remain flexible, allowing a baby's skull to expand as the brain grows. In the front of the skull, the sutures meet in the large soft spot (fontanel) on top of the head. The anterior fontanel is the soft spot felt just behind a baby's forehead. The next largest fontanel is at the back (posterior). Each side of the skull has a tiny fontanel. Craniosynostosis usually involves premature fusion of a single cranial suture, but it can involve more than one of the sutures in a baby's skull (multiple suture craniosynostosis). In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes (syndromic craniosynostosis). Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for brain growth. Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby's brain adequate space to grow and develop. Although neurological damage can occur in severe cases, most children develop as expected in their ability to think and reason (cognitive development) and have good cosmetic results after surgery.

The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body.

So the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of ventricular tachycardia are due to a lack of oxygen. They may include: Ventricular tachycardia can be a medical emergency even if your symptoms are minor. Ventricular tachycardia, sometimes called V-tach or VT, is grouped according to how long an episode lasts. Symptoms of sustained V-tach may include:', 'Causes': \"Ventricular tachycardia is caused by faulty heart signaling that makes the heart beat too fast in the lower heart chambers. The lower heart chambers are called the ventricles. The fast heart rate doesn't allow the ventricles to fill and squeeze to pump enough blood to the body. Many things can cause or lead to problems with heart signaling and trigger ventricular tachycardia. These include: Sometimes, the exact cause of ventricular tachycardia can't be determined. This is called idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.\"}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Cyclothymia (cyclothymic disorder)', 'Overview': \"Cyclothymia (sy-kloe-THIE-me-uh), also called cyclothymic disorder, is a rare mood disorder. Cyclothymia causes emotional ups and downs, but they're not as extreme as those in bipolar I or II disorder. With cyclothymia, you experience periods when your mood noticeably shifts up and down from your baseline. You may feel on top of the world for a time, followed by a low period when you feel somewhat down. Between these cyclothymic highs and lows, you may feel stable and fine. Although the highs and lows of cyclothymia are less extreme than those of bipolar disorder, it's critical to seek help managing these symptoms because they can interfere with your ability to function and increase your risk of bipolar I or II disorder. Treatment options for cyclothymia include talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications and close, ongoing follow-up with your doctor.\", 'Symptoms': \"Cyclothymia symptoms alternate between emotional highs and lows. The highs of cyclothymia include symptoms of an elevated mood (hypomanic symptoms). The lows consist of mild or moderate depressive symptoms. Cyclothymia symptoms are similar to those of bipolar I or II disorder, but they're less severe. When you have cyclothymia, you can typically function in your daily life, though not always well. The unpredictable nature of your mood shifts may significantly disrupt your life because you never know how you're going to feel.\", 'Causes': \"It's not known specifically what causes cyclothymia.

In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to press on nearby nerves and parts of the brain or spinal cord.

The aortic valve has flaps, also called cusps or leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat. In aortic valve regurgitation, the valve doesn't close properly. This causes blood to leak back into the lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle. As a result, the chamber holds more blood. This could cause it to get larger and thicken.

Depending on the strain, bird flu may cause the bird to have no symptoms, mild illness, serious illness or lead to the death of the bird. Bird flu rarely infects humans. But health officials worry because influenza A viruses that infect birds can change, called mutate, to infect humans and spread from person to person more often. Because a new strain of bird flu would be a new virus to humans, a mutated strain like that could spread quickly around the world. People most often catch a bird flu virus from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. People also may catch bird flu through contact with wild birds or another type of animal. Bird flu rarely has spread from person to person. In humans, flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. Symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to flu symptoms and may be mild to serious.', 'Symptoms': 'Bird flu symptoms can be mild to serious in a person. Symptoms typically show up within seven days of contact with the virus but can take as long as two weeks. A person can get infected from direct contact with an infected animal, or the bedding or stool of the animal. Flu viruses have similar symptoms. So you need to be tested to check if you have a bird flu infection. Common bird flu symptoms include: Bird flu may cause breathing problems more often than other kinds of flu. And during bird flu pandemics, the risk that a person with flu will need a machine to help them breathe is higher.', 'Causes': \"Influenza is caused by viruses that infect the cells that line the nose, throat and lungs. Flu virus particles spread through breath, saliva, mucus or stool. Bird flu in humans can happen when you inhale virus particles. You also can catch the virus if you touch an object with flu particles on it, and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. People most often catch bird flu from close, long-term contact with live, domesticated poultry typically on farms or in backyard coops. Rarely, people are exposed to bird flu by contact with wild birds or another type of animal. But birds you may see in a park or yard, such as crows or sparrows, aren't a high risk. They don't usually carry bird flu viruses that infect people or farm animals. It may be possible to be exposed to bird flu through undercooked foods, such as eggs or poultry.  In places where bird flu has spread to dairy cows, it may be possible to get bird flu through raw dairy products.

Asthma is a long-term condition that makes breathing difficult because airways in the lungs become narrow. Symptoms of asthma attack include coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest and difficulty getting enough air. These symptoms happen because muscles around airways tighten up, the airways become irritated and swollen, and the lining of the airways produces a fluid called mucus. All of these factors make it difficult to breathe. People who already have a diagnosis of asthma usually have an asthma action plan. This tells them what medicines to take if they have an asthma attack and when to get emergency care. People who do not have a diagnosis or don't have a treatment plan should get emergency care if they have these symptoms. Frequent asthma attacks show that a person's asthma is not under control.

But with proper treatment, most people who have CAH can lead full lives.', 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of CAH vary. The symptoms depend on which gene is affected. They also depend on how greatly the adrenal glands lack one of the enzymes needed to make hormones. With CAH, the hormones that the body needs to work properly are thrown out of balance. That may lead to too little cortisol, too little aldosterone, too many androgens or a mix of these issues.', 'Causes': \"The most common cause of CAH is the lack of the enzyme protein known as 21-hydroxylase. Sometimes, CAH is called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The body needs this enzyme to make proper amounts of hormones. Very rarely, a lack of other much rarer enzymes also can cause CAH. CAH is a genetic condition. That means it's passed from parents to children. It's present at birth. Children with the condition have two parents who both carry the genetic change that causes CAH. Or they have two parents who have CAH themselves. This is known as the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. People can carry the CAH gene and not have symptoms of the condition. This is called being a silent carrier. If a silent carrier becomes pregnant, that person can pass the gene to a child. If tests show that you're a silent carrier of the CAH gene and you have a partner of the opposite sex, talk with your healthcare professional.

It's not always clear what causes the changes that lead to this eye cancer. Retinoblastoma starts when cells in the eye get changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions also tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. In retinoblastoma, this growth of cells happens in the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining on the inside of the eye. The retina is made up of nerve tissue that senses light as it comes in through the front of the eye. The light causes the retina to send signals to the brain. The brain interprets the signals as images. As the cancer cells build up in the retina, they can form a mass, called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Retinoblastoma rarely spreads, especially if it's found early. For most instances of retinoblastoma, it's not clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to cancer.

They include the opening of the vagina and the labia, clitoris, penis and scrotum. Internal genitals are the sex organs inside the body. They include the vagina, fallopian tubes, uterus, prostate, ovaries and testicles. Sex hormones are made by the ovaries and testicles, which also are called gonads. Genetic sex is set based on sex chromosomes. Typically, these sex chromosomes are a genetic female with two X chromosomes and a genetic male with one X and one Y chromosome. Atypical genitalia is not a disease; it's a difference of sex development. Usually, atypical genitalia can be seen at or shortly after birth. The condition can be very distressing for families. Your medical team looks for the cause of atypical genitalia and provides information and counseling that can help guide decisions about your baby's sex and any needed treatment.\", 'Symptoms': 'Your medical team will likely be the first to notice atypical genitalia soon after your baby is born.

Anaphylaxis is a possibly life-threatening condition that can cause throat swelling and serious difficulty breathing. A healthcare professional can find out if you have a latex allergy or if you're at risk of developing a latex allergy. Understanding latex allergy and knowing common sources of latex can help you prevent allergic reactions.\", 'Symptoms': \"If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves. Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to serious. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure.\", 'Causes': \"In a latex allergy, the immune system identifies latex as a harmful substance and triggers certain antibodies to fight it off. The next time there is a latex exposure, these antibodies tell the immune system to release histamine and other chemicals into the bloodstream. This process produces a range of allergy symptoms. The more times someone is exposed to latex, the more strongly their immune system is likely to respond. This is called sensitization. Latex allergy can happen in these ways: It's possible to have other skin reactions when using latex. They include: Not all latex products are made from natural sources.

It may also be called neurocardiogenic syncope. The vasovagal syncope trigger causes your heart rate and blood pressure to drop suddenly. That leads to reduced blood flow to your brain, causing you to briefly lose consciousness. Vasovagal syncope is usually harmless and requires no treatment. But it's possible that you may injure yourself during a vasovagal syncope episode.

      "{'disease': \"Barrett's esophagus\", 'Overview': \"Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the flat pink lining of the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (esophagus) becomes damaged by acid reflux, which causes the lining to thicken and become red. Between the esophagus and the stomach is a critically important valve, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Over time, the LES may begin to fail, leading to acid and chemical damage of the esophagus, a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is often accompanied by symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation. In some people, this GERD may trigger a change in the cells lining the lower esophagus, causing Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer. Although the risk of developing esophageal cancer is small, it's important to have regular checkups with careful imaging and extensive biopsies of the esophagus to check for precancerous cells (dysplasia). If precancerous cells are discovered, they can be treated to prevent esophageal cancer.\", 'Symptoms': \"The development of Barrett's esophagus is most often attributed to long-standing GERD, which may include these signs and symptoms: Curiously, approximately half of the people diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus report little if any symptoms of acid reflux.

When a tumor isn't cancer, it's called benign. You have two adrenal glands — one at the top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make hormones that help control key processes in the body, such as blood pressure. Usually, a pheochromocytoma forms in only one adrenal gland. But tumors can grow in both adrenal glands. With a pheochromocytoma, the tumor releases hormones that can cause various symptoms. They include high blood pressure, headache, sweating and symptoms of a panic attack. If a pheochromocytoma isn't treated, serious or life-threatening damage to other body systems can happen. Surgery to remove a pheochromocytoma often returns blood pressure to a healthy range.\", 'Symptoms': \"A pheochromocytoma often causes the following symptoms: Some people with pheochromocytomas also have symptoms such as: Some people with pheochromocytomas have no symptoms. They don't realize they have the tumor until an imaging test happens to find it.\", 'Causes': \"Researchers don't know exactly what causes a pheochromocytoma. The tumor forms in cells called chromaffin cells. These cells are located in the center of an adrenal gland. They release certain hormones, mainly adrenaline and noradrenaline. These hormones help control many body functions, such as heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar. Adrenaline and noradrenaline trigger the body's fight-or-flight response. That response happens when the body thinks there is a threat. The hormones cause blood pressure to rise and the heart to beat faster. They also prepare other body systems so you can react quickly. A pheochromocytoma causes more of these hormones to be released. And it causes them to be released when you're not in a threatening situation. Most of the chromaffin cells are in the adrenal glands. But small clusters of these cells also are in the heart, head, neck, bladder, stomach area and along the spine. Chromaffin cell tumors located outside of the adrenal glands are called paragangliomas.

In some children, intense and ongoing separation anxiety is a sign of a more serious condition known as separation anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder can be identified as early as preschool age. Your child may have separation anxiety disorder if separation anxiety seems more intense than other kids of the same age or lasts a longer time, interferes with school or other daily activities, or includes panic attacks or other problem behaviors. Most often, separation anxiety relates to the child's anxiety about being away from parents or guardians, but it could relate to another close caregiver.

Once diagnosed, however, pseudobulbar affect can be managed with medication.\", 'Symptoms': \"The primary sign of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is frequent, involuntary and uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing that are exaggerated or not connected to your emotional state. Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing. The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded. Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect.

People with WPW syndrome have an extra pathway for signals to travel between the heart's upper and lower chambers. This causes a fast heartbeat. Changes in the heartbeat can make it harder for the heart to work as it should. WPW syndrome is fairly rare. Another name for it is preexcitation syndrome. The episodes of fast heartbeats seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome usually aren't life-threatening. But serious heart problems can occur. Rarely, the syndrome may lead to sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. Treatment of WPW syndrome may include special actions, medicines, a shock to the heart or a procedure to stop the irregular heartbeats.\", 'Symptoms': 'The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats each minute. A fast heart rate is called tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh). The most common symptom of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute. In WPW syndrome, the fast heartbeat can begin suddenly. It may last a few seconds or several hours. Episodes may occur during exercise or while at rest. Other symptoms of WPW syndrome may depend on the speed of the heartbeat and the underlying heart rhythm disorder. For example, the most common irregular heartbeat seen with WPW syndrome is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). During an episode of  SVT, the heart beats about 150 to 220 times a minute, but it can occasionally beat faster or slower. Some people with WPW syndrome also have a fast and chaotic heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation. In general, symptoms of WPW syndrome include:', 'Causes': \"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart condition present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect. Researchers aren't sure what causes most types of congenital heart defects. WPW syndrome may occur with other congenital heart defects, such as Ebstein anomaly. Rarely, WPW syndrome is passed down through families. Your healthcare team may call this inherited or familial WPW syndrome. It is associated with a thickened heart muscle, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To understand the causes of WPW syndrome, it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats. The heart has four chambers. Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that start each heartbeat. The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers. In a typical heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is about 60 to 100 beats a minute. In WPW syndrome, an extra electrical pathway connects the upper and lower heart chambers, allowing heart signals to bypass the AV node. As a result, the heart signals don't slow down. The signals get excited, and the heart rate gets faster. The extra pathway also can cause heart signals to travel backward. This causes an uncoordinated heart rhythm.\"}\n",

It's the type of seizure most people picture when they think about seizures. During a seizure, there's a burst of electrical activity in the brain that causes changes in behavior and movements. Seizures can be focal, meaning the burst of electrical activity happens in one area of the brain. Or seizures can be generalized, in which they result in electrical activity in all areas of the brain. Tonic-clonic seizures may begin as focal seizures in a small area of the brain and spread to become generalized seizures that involve the whole brain. Focal and generalized seizures have different symptoms. People who have generalized seizures usually lose consciousness. But people who have focal seizures may or may not lose consciousness. In tonic-clonic seizures, the muscles become stiff, causing the person to fall. Then the muscles alternately flex and relax. Usually, a tonic-clonic seizure is caused by epilepsy. But sometimes this type of seizure can be triggered by other health problems, such as a high fever or damage to the brain. Some people who have a tonic-clonic seizure don’t have another one and don't need treatment. But someone who has recurrent seizures may need treatment with daily anti-seizure medicines to control and prevent future tonic-clonic seizures. Surgery and dietary changes also may be options to manage your seizures.\", 'Symptoms': 'Tonic-clonic seizures have two stages: The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic-clonic seizures:', 'Causes': \"The brain's nerve cells typically communicate by sending electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect the cells. A synapse is the area between cells that allows them to send messages. Tonic-clonic seizures occur when there's a surge of electrical activity over the surface of the brain.

Most often, muscles contract to send food through the digestive tract. But with gastroparesis, the stomach's movement, called motility, slows or doesn't work at all. This keeps the stomach from emptying well. Often, the cause of gastroparesis is not known. Sometimes it's linked to diabetes. And some people get gastroparesis after surgery or after a viral illness. Certain medicines, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and medicines for high blood pressure, weight loss and allergies can slow stomach emptying. The symptoms can be like those of gastroparesis. For people who already have gastroparesis, these medicines may make the condition worse. Gastroparesis affects digestion. It can cause nausea, vomiting and belly pain. It also can cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. There's no cure for gastroparesis. But medicines and changes to diet can give some relief.\", 'Symptoms': \"Symptoms of gastroparesis include: Many people with gastroparesis don't notice any symptoms.\", 'Causes': \"It's not always clear what leads to gastroparesis. But sometimes damage to a nerve that controls the stomach muscles can cause it. This nerve is called the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve helps manage what happens in the digestive tract. This includes telling the muscles in the stomach to contract and push food into the small intestine. A damaged vagus nerve can't send signals to the stomach muscles as it should. This may cause food to stay in the stomach longer. Conditions such as diabetes or surgery to the stomach or small intestine can damage the vagus nerve and its branches.\"}\n",

Hypocretin levels are low in people who have cataplexy. Exactly what causes the loss of hypocretin-producing cells in the brain isn't known. But experts suspect it's due to an autoimmune reaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the body's immune system destroys its own cells. It's also likely that genetics plays a role in narcolepsy. But the risk of a parent passing this sleep condition to a child is very low — only about 1% to 2%. Narcolepsy may be linked to exposure to the H1N1 flu, sometimes called the swine flu.

      "{'disease': 'Mitral valve stenosis', 'Overview': \"Mitral valve stenosis — sometimes called mitral stenosis — is a narrowing of the valve between the two left heart chambers. The narrowed valve reduces or blocks blood flow into the lower left heart chamber. The lower left heart chamber is the heart's main pumping chamber. It also is called the left ventricle. Mitral valve stenosis can make you tired and short of breath. Other symptoms may include irregular heartbeats, dizziness, chest pain or coughing up blood. Some people don't notice symptoms. Mitral valve stenosis can be caused by a complication of strep throat called rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is now rare in the United States. Treatment for mitral valve stenosis may include medicine or mitral valve repair or replacement surgery. Some people only need regular health checkups. Treatment depends on how severe the valve disease is and whether it's getting worse. Untreated, mitral valve stenosis can lead to serious heart complications.\", 'Symptoms': 'Mitral valve stenosis usually worsens slowly. You may not have any symptoms, or you may have mild ones for many years. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis can occur at any age, even during childhood. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis include: Mitral valve stenosis symptoms may appear or get worse when the heart rate increases, such as during exercise. Anything that puts stress on the body, including pregnancy or infections, may trigger symptoms.', 'Causes': \"To understand the causes of mitral valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works. The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart that keep blood flowing in the right direction. Each valve has flaps, called leaflets, that open and close once during each heartbeat. If a valve doesn't open or close properly, less blood may flow through the heart to the body. In mitral valve stenosis, the valve opening narrows. The heart now must work harder to force blood through the smaller valve opening. Blood flow between the upper left and lower left heart chambers may decrease. Causes of mitral valve stenosis include:\"}\n",

The pain may be constant or it may occur only occasionally, and it can occur in men, women and transgender people. Breast pain can range from mild to severe. It may occur: In men, breast pain is most commonly caused by a condition called \"gynecomastia\" (guy-nuh-koh-MAS-tee-uh). This refers to an increase in the amount of breast gland tissue that\\'s caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Gynecomastia can affect one or both breasts, sometimes unevenly. In transgender women, hormone therapy may cause breast pain. In transgender men, breast pain may be caused by the minimal amount of breast tissue that may remain after a mastectomy. Most times, breast pain signals a noncancerous (benign) breast condition and rarely indicates breast cancer. Unexplained breast pain that doesn\\'t go away after one or two menstrual cycles, or that persists after menopause, or breast pain that doesn\\'t seem to be related to hormone changes needs to be evaluated.', 'Symptoms': \"Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic. Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern. Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there's not a regular pattern. Each type of breast pain has distinct characteristics.\", 'Causes': \"Changing hormone levels can cause changes in the milk ducts or milk glands. These changes in the ducts and glands can cause breast cysts, which can be painful and are a common cause of cyclic breast pain. Noncyclic breast pain may be caused by trauma, prior breast surgery or other factors. Sometimes, it's not possible to identify the exact cause of breast pain, but some factors may increase the risk.\"}\n",
      "{'disease': 'Stress incontinence', 'Overview': \"Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control. Stress incontinence happens when movement or activity puts pressure on the bladder, causing urine to leak. Movements include coughing, laughing, sneezing, running or heavy lifting. Stress incontinence is not related to mental stress. Stress incontinence is not the same as urgency incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB). Those conditions cause the bladder muscle to spasm. This leads to a sudden need to urinate quickly. Stress incontinence is much more common in women than in men. If you have stress incontinence, you may feel ashamed. You might limit your work and social life because you don't want to be with others. You also might not do physical or fun activities. Treatment can help you manage stress incontinence and improve your quality of life.\", 'Symptoms': 'If you have stress incontinence, you may leak urine when you: You might not leak urine every time you do one of these things. But any activity that puts pressure on your bladder can make leaking more likely. Having a full bladder increases the chances of leaking.', 'Causes': 'Stress incontinence happens when certain muscles and other tissues linked to urinating weaken. These include the muscles that support the urethra, called the pelvic floor muscles, and the muscles that control the release of urine, called the urinary sphincter. The bladder expands as it fills with urine. Most often, valve-like muscles in the tube that carries urine out of the body, called the urethra, stay closed as the bladder expands. This keeps you from leaking urine until you reach a bathroom. But when those muscles weaken, anything that puts force on the stomach and pelvic muscles put pressure on your bladder. Sneezing, bending over, lifting or laughing hard, for instance, can cause urine leakage.'}\n",

It mainly occurs in people playing recreational sports, but it can happen to anyone. The Achilles tendon is a strong fibrous cord that connects the muscles in the back of your calf to your heel bone. If you overstretch your Achilles tendon, it can tear (rupture) completely or just partially. If your Achilles tendon ruptures, you might hear a pop, followed by an immediate sharp pain in the back of your ankle and lower leg that is likely to affect your ability to walk properly. Surgery is often performed to repair the rupture. For many people, however, nonsurgical treatment works just as well.', 'Symptoms': \"Although it's possible to have no signs or symptoms with an Achilles tendon rupture, most people have:\", 'Causes': 'Your Achilles tendon helps you point your foot downward, rise on your toes and push off your foot as you walk. You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot. Rupture usually occurs in the section of the tendon situated within 2 1/2 inches (about 6 centimeters) of the point where it attaches to the heel bone. This section might be prone to rupture because blood flow is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal. Ruptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon.

Cholestasis of pregnancy can make you very uncomfortable. But more worrisome are the potential complications, especially for your baby. Because of the risk of complications, your pregnancy care provider may recommend early term delivery around 37 weeks.', 'Symptoms': \"Intense itching is the main symptom of cholestasis of pregnancy. But there is no rash. Typically, you feel itchy on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet, but you may feel itchy everywhere. The itching is often worse at night and may bother you so much that you can't sleep. The itching is most common during the third trimester of pregnancy but sometimes begins earlier. It may feel worse as your due date gets near. But once your baby arrives, the itchiness usually goes away within a few days. Other less common signs and symptoms of cholestasis of pregnancy may include:\", 'Causes': 'The exact cause of cholestasis of pregnancy is unclear. Cholestasis is reduced or stopped bile flow. Bile is the digestive fluid made in the liver that helps break down fats. Instead of leaving the liver for the small intestine, bile builds up in the liver. As a result, bile acids eventually enter the bloodstream. High levels of bile acids appear to cause the symptoms and complications of cholestasis of pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones, genetics and the environment may all play a role.'}\n",

For this reason, frontal lobe seizures can produce symptoms that are unusual and may appear to be related to a mental illness. The seizures also can be mistaken for a sleep disorder because they often occur during sleep. Frontal lobe seizures also are known as frontal lobe epilepsy.

Tonsil cancer is often diagnosed late in the disease. Often, the cancer has spread to nearby areas, such as the lymph nodes in the neck. Tonsil cancer is considered a kind of throat cancer. Tonsil cancer happens in the part of the throat that's behind the mouth, called the oropharynx. Cancer that starts in this part of the throat is sometimes called oropharyngeal cancer. Treatments for tonsil cancer include surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\", 'Symptoms': 'Signs and symptoms of tonsil cancer include:', 'Causes': \"Tonsil cancer happens when cells in the tonsils develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. It's not always clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to tonsil cancer. For many tonsil cancers, human papillomavirus is thought to have a part. Human papillomavirus, also called HPV, is a common virus that's passed through sexual contact. For most people, HPV doesn't cause any problems. For others, it causes changes in the cells that may one day lead to cancer.

There are three forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy, which involve different age ranges: late infantile form, juvenile form and adult form. Signs and symptoms can vary. The infantile form is the most common and progresses more rapidly than the other forms. There is no cure for metachromatic leukodystrophy yet. Depending on the form and age of onset, early identification and treatment may help manage some signs and symptoms and delay progression of the disorder.', 'Symptoms': 'Damage to the protective myelin covering the nerves results in progressive worsening of brain and nervous system functions, including: Each form of metachromatic leukodystrophy occurs at a different age and can have different initial signs and symptoms and rates of progression:', 'Causes': 'Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an inherited disorder caused by an abnormal (mutated) gene. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The abnormal recessive gene is located on one of the nonsex chromosomes (autosomes). To inherit an autosomal recessive disorder, both parents must be carriers, but they do not typically show signs of the condition. The affected child inherits two copies of the abnormal gene — one from each parent. The most common cause of metachromatic leukodystrophy is a mutation in the ARSA gene. This mutation results in a lack of the enzyme that breaks down lipids called sulfatides that build up in the myelin. Rarely, metachromatic leukodystrophy is caused by a deficiency in another kind of protein (activator protein) that breaks down sulfatides. This is caused by a mutation in the PSAP gene. The buildup of sulfatides is toxic, destroying the myelin-producing cells — also called white matter — that protect the nerves.

Dry socket happens when a blood clot at the site where the tooth was removed does not form, comes out or dissolves before the wound has healed. Usually a blood clot forms at the site where a tooth was removed. This blood clot is a protective layer over the underlying bone and nerve endings in the empty tooth socket. Also, the clot contains cells that are needed for proper healing of the site. Intense pain happens when the underlying bone and nerves are exposed. Pain occurs in the socket and along the nerves to the side of the face. The socket becomes swollen and irritated. It may fill with bits of food, making the pain worse. If you get a dry socket, the pain usually begins 1 to 3 days after the tooth removal. Dry socket is the most common complication following tooth removals, such as the removal of third molars, also called wisdom teeth.

The changes tell the tumor cells to make many more cells quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The extra cells might form a mass called a tumor. A tumor can grow and press on nearby brain tissue. Sometimes a growing tumor causes swelling and other changes in the nearby brain tissue. Some tumor cells develop other DNA changes that turn them into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy tissue. Sometimes cancer cells can break away and spread beyond the brain.

Most people who have agoraphobia develop it after having one or more panic attacks, causing them to worry about having another attack. They then avoid the places where it may happen again. Agoraphobia often results in having a hard time feeling safe in any public place, especially where crowds gather and in locations that are not familiar. You may feel that you need a companion, such as a family member or friend, to go with you to public places. The fear can be so overwhelming that you may feel you can't leave your home.

If hip dysplasia is diagnosed in early infancy, a soft brace can usually correct the problem. Mild hip dysplasia might not start causing symptoms until a person is a teenager or young adult. Hip dysplasia can damage the cartilage lining the joint. It also can hurt the soft cartilage, called the labrum, that rims the socket portion of the hip joint. This is called a hip labral tear.

It mainly causes tumors in the glands that make and release hormones. These are called the endocrine glands. The condition also can cause tumors in the small intestine and stomach. Another name for MEN 1 is Wermer's syndrome. The endocrine gland tumors that form due to MEN 1 usually are not cancer. Most often, the tumors grow on the parathyroid glands, the pancreas and the pituitary gland. Some glands affected by MEN 1 also may release too many hormones. That can lead to other health concerns. The extra hormones of MEN 1 can cause many symptoms. These symptoms may include tiredness, bone pain, broken bones, kidney stones, and ulcers in the stomach or intestines. MEN 1 can't be cured. But regular testing can detect health concerns, and healthcare professionals can provide treatment as needed. MEN 1 is an inherited condition. That means people who have a genetic change that causes MEN 1 can pass it on to their children.\", 'Symptoms': 'Symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) can include the following: Symptoms are caused by the release of too many hormones in the body.', 'Causes': \"Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is caused by a change in the MEN1 gene. That gene controls how the body makes a protein called menin. Menin helps to keep cells in the body from growing and dividing too quickly. Many different changes in the MEN1 gene can cause the MEN 1 condition to develop. People who have one of those genetic changes can pass it on to their children. Many people with a change in the MEN1 gene inherit it from a parent. But some people are the first in their family to have a new MEN1 gene change that doesn't come from a parent.\"}\n",

      "If you have symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, or you've been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, contact your healthcare team. Let them know if you've had close contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19.\n",
      "In the United States, at-home COVID-19 tests are available. Free tests can be mailed to U.S. addresses, or you can purchase tests in stores, pharmacies or online. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA, approves or authorizes the tests. On the FDA website, you can find a list of the tests that are validated and their expiration dates. You also can check with your healthcare professional before buying a test if you have any concerns.\n",
      "When taking a test at home, read the directions that come with the test carefully. Follow the instructions exactly to get as accurate a result as possible.\n",
      "COVID-19 tests also are available from healthcare professionals, some pharmacies and clinics, or at community testing sites.\n",
      "Here are some guidelines for when to take a COVID-19 test:\n",
      "- If you have COVID-19 symptoms, test for the illness right away.\n",
      "- If you were exposed to the COVID-19 virus but don't have symptoms, wait at least five days after exposure then test.\n",
      "- If you have symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 30 days, you can test again. But if you were just exposed to the coronavirus and don't have symptoms, you don't need to test.\n",
      "Also, testing before an event or contact with people at high risk of serious illness helps prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n",
      "COVID-19 tests use a sample taken from your nose or throat, or a sample of saliva.\n",
      "Two types of tests can help diagnose COVID-19.\n",
      "- Molecular tests. These tests look for genetic material from the COVID-19 virus.\n",
      "Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You may also see this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test.\n",
      "PCR tests are more accurate than the other type of COVID-19 test, called an antigen test. PCR tests may be done at home. But they are much more likely to be done by a healthcare professional and processed in a lab.\n",
      "- Antigen tests. These tests look for viral proteins called antigens.\n",
      "Antigen tests also may be called rapid COVID-19 tests or at-home COVID-19 tests. These tests are useful if you need a quick result.\n",
      "Antigen tests are reliable and accurate, but they are less accurate than PCR tests. This is especially true if you don't have symptoms. If you take an antigen test and are negative for COVID-19, take another antigen test after 48 hours to get the most accurate result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Many people with COVID-19 recover with rest, plenty of fluids and care that manages symptoms. Medicine you can get without a prescription can help, such as:\n",
      "- Fever reducers.\n",
      "- Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.\n",
      "- Cough syrup or medicine.\n",
      "If you are at high risk of serious COVID-19 illness, your healthcare professional may suggest medicine to prevent mild illness from getting worse. These medicines can include nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid), remdesivir (Veklury) or molnupiravir (Lagevrio).\n",
      "Paxlovid and Lagevrio are taken by mouth as pills. Veklury is given through a needle in a vein.\n",

      "These exams and tests often include:\n",
      "- Taking your health history. Your health care team may review your weight history, weight-loss efforts, physical activity and exercise habits. You also may talk about your eating patterns and appetite control. Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions.\n",
      "- A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen.\n",
      "- Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you.\n",
      "- Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year.\n",
      "- Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes.\n",
      "Gathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. This improves overall health and lowers the risk of developing complications related to obesity.\n",
      "You may need to work with a team of health professionals — including a dietitian, behavioral counselor or an obesity specialist — to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits.\n",
      "The first treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss — 5% to 10% of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms), you'd need to lose only about 10 to 20 pounds (4.5 to 9 kilograms) for your health to begin to improve. But the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits.\n",
      "All weight-loss programs require that you change your eating habits and get more active. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your weight, your overall health and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan.\n",

      "An important part of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease includes being able to explain your symptoms. It may help to get input from a close family member or friend about your symptoms and their impact on your daily life. Tests of memory and thinking skills also help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "Blood and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. They also can check for proteins in the brain that are linked to Alzheimer's disease. The tests may help your healthcare team better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms.\n",
      "In the past, Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed for certain only after death when plaques and tangles were found while looking at the brain with a microscope. Today, healthcare professionals and researchers are able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty.\n",
      "They do this by using a combination of tests that may include tests for biomarkers. Biomarkers can detect if plaques and tangles are present in the brain. Biomarker tests include specific types of positron emission tomography, also known as PET, scans of the brain. Amyloid and tau proteins also can be measured in the fluid part of the blood or in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, known as cerebrospinal fluid. Recently, blood biomarker tests have become accurate enough to tell if someone is likely to have amyloid in the brain.\n",
      "Biomarker tests were mainly used in clinical trials until recently. But healthcare professionals have started using them along with other tests to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Biomarker tests also can let healthcare professionals know if the disease is in the early or later stages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatments for Alzheimer's disease include medicines that can help with symptoms and newer medicines that can help slow decline in thinking and functioning. These newer medicines are approved for people with early Alzheimer's disease.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "To diagnose the flu, also called influenza, your healthcare professional does a physical exam, looks for symptoms of flu and possibly orders a test that detects flu viruses.\n",
      "The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. During times when flu is widespread, you may not need a flu test.\n",
      "But a test for flu may be suggested to help guide your care or to know if you could spread the virus to others. A flu test may be done by a pharmacy, your healthcare professional's office or in the hospital. For people age 2 and older, a test you can take at home may be available. If you do use an at-home test, let your healthcare professional know the results. You may need to confirm the results, positive or negative, with a test from your healthcare team.\n",
      "Types of flu tests you may have include:\n",
      "- Molecular tests. These tests look for genetic material from the flu virus. Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You also may hear this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test.\n",
      "- Antigen tests. These tests look for viral proteins called antigens. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are one example of antigen tests.\n",
      "It's possible to have a test to diagnose both flu and other respiratory illness, such as COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. You may have both COVID-19 and influenza at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "If you have a severe infection or are at high risk of complications from a flu infection, your healthcare professional may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat the flu. These medicines can include oseltamivir (Tamiflu), baloxavir (Xofluza) and zanamivir (Relenza).\n",
      "You take oseltamivir and baloxavir by mouth. You inhale zanamivir using a device similar to an asthma inhaler. Zanamivir shouldn't be used by anyone with certain chronic respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease.\n",
      "People who are in the hospital may be prescribed peramivir (Rapivab), which is given in a vein.\n",
      "These medicines may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications.\n",
      "Antiviral medicine may cause side effects. The side effects often are listed on the prescription information. In general, antiviral medicine side effects may include breathing symptoms, nausea, vomiting or loose stools called diarrhea.\n",

A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis also involves ruling out other conditions that might produce similar symptoms. This is known as a differential diagnosis.\n",
      "Tests used to diagnose MS may include:\n",
      "- MRI, which can reveal areas of MS on the brain and spinal cord. These areas are called lesions. A contrast dye may be given through an IV to highlight lesions that show the disease is in an active phase.\n",
      "- Lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap, in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from the spinal canal for lab testing. This sample can show changes in antibodies that are linked to MS. A spinal tap also can help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to MS. An antibody test that looks for kappa free light chains may be faster and less expensive than previous spinal fluid tests for MS.\n",
      "- Optical coherence tomography, which uses light waves to produce images of the eye. In MS, a condition called optic neuritis causes changes in the retina. Optical coherence tomography may be used to measure thickness of the retina. It also may show damage to the retinal nerve fiber.\n",
      "- Evoked potential tests, which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli. In these tests, you watch a moving visual pattern, as short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways.\n",
      "- Blood tests, which can help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to MS. Tests to check for specific biomarkers linked to MS are being developed. These tests may help with diagnosing the disease.\n",
      "- Neuropsychological testing. Neuropsychological testing involves looking at how your brain is working. Testing examines your thinking, memory, language and social skills. It also assesses your personality and mood. A psychologist with specific expertise, known as a neuropsychologist, does this testing. Neuropsychological testing is important in MS because most people with the disease have cognitive impairment. This can include memory loss and trouble with language and thinking skills that affect daily activities. Your healthcare professional may give you a baseline test soon after you are diagnosed. Then you may be retested over time.\n",
      "In most people with relapsing-remitting MS, the diagnosis is straightforward. Diagnosis is based on a pattern of symptoms related to MS and confirmed by test results.\n",

      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "STDs may be treated in different ways based on the causes.  Sexually transmitted infections caused by bacteria are generally easier to treat. STI infections caused by viruses can be managed and treated but not always cured.\n",
      "If you are pregnant and have an STD, getting treatment right away can prevent or lower the risk of your baby becoming infected.\n",
      "Treatment for sexually transmitted infections usually consists of one of the following, depending on the infection:\n",
      "- Antibiotics. Antibiotics, often in a single dose, can cure many STIs caused by bacteria or parasites, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia and trichomoniasis.\n",
      "Once you start antibiotic treatment, you need to finish the prescription. If you don't think you'll be able to take medicine as prescribed, tell your health care professional. A shorter, simpler course of treatment may be available.\n",
      "Also, it's important to avoid sexual activity until seven days after you've completed antibiotic treatment and any sores have healed.\n",
      "Experts also suggest people diagnosed with chlamydia be retested three months after treatment because there's a high chance of reinfection.\n",
      "- Antiviral drugs. If you have herpes or HIV, your doctor may prescribe medicine that keeps a viral infection from getting worse, called an antiviral medicine.\n",
      "You'll generally have fewer herpes recurrences if you take what's called daily suppressive therapy with a prescription antiviral medicine. But it's still possible to give your partner herpes.\n",
      "Antiviral medicines can keep HIV infection in check for many years. But you will still carry the virus and can still spread it, though the risk is lower.\n",
      "The sooner you start HIV treatment, the more effective it is. If you take your medicines as directed, it's possible to lower the viral load in the blood so that it can't be found. At that point, you won't spread the virus to sex partners.\n",
      "If you've had a sexually transmitted infection, ask your health care professional how long after treatment you need to be retested. Getting retested will ensure that the treatment worked and that you haven't been reinfected.\n",

      "Doctors may find chronic leukemia in a routine blood test, before symptoms begin. If this happens, or if you have signs or symptoms that suggest leukemia, you may undergo the following diagnostic exams:\n",
      "- Physical exam. Your doctor will look for physical signs of leukemia, such as pale skin from anemia, swelling of your lymph nodes, and enlargement of your liver and spleen.\n",
      "- Blood tests. By looking at a sample of your blood, your doctor can determine if you have abnormal levels of red or white blood cells or platelets — which may suggest leukemia. A blood test may also show the presence of leukemia cells, though not all types of leukemia cause the leukemia cells to circulate in the blood. Sometimes the leukemia cells stay in the bone marrow.\n",
      "- Bone marrow test. Your doctor may recommend a procedure to remove a sample of bone marrow from your hipbone. The bone marrow is removed using a long, thin needle. The sample is sent to a laboratory to look for leukemia cells. Specialized tests of your leukemia cells may reveal certain characteristics that are used to determine your treatment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for your leukemia depends on many factors. Your doctor determines your leukemia treatment options based on your age and overall health, the type of leukemia you have, and whether it has spread to other parts of your body, including the central nervous system.\n",
      "Common treatments used to fight leukemia include:\n",
      "- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells.\n",
      "Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein.\n",
      "- Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body.\n",
      "You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a bone marrow transplant.\n",
      "- Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\n",
      "Prior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help rebuild your bone marrow.\n",
      "You may receive stem cells from a donor or you may be able to use your own stem cells.\n",
      "- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.\n",
      "- Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body. CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for certain types of leukemia.\n",
      "- Clinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, treatment benefits and risks may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.\n",

      "The goals of treatment are to destroy the wart, stimulate an immune system response to fight the virus or both. Treatment may take weeks or months. Even if warts clear up with treatment, they tend to come back or spread. Your healthcare professional will likely suggest starting treatment with the least painful method, particularly when treating young children.\n",
      "Treatment for common warts includes the following approaches. Which is best for you depends on the where the wart is, your symptoms and your preferences. These methods are sometimes combined with home treatments.\n",
      "- Prescription-strength peeling medicine. Wart medicines with salicylic acid work by removing layers of a wart a little bit at a time. Studies show that salicylic acid is more effective when combined with freezing or pulsed-dye laser treatment.\n",
      "- 5-fluoruracil. This wart medicine is applied directly to the wart and keep under a bandage for 12 weeks. This method is often used with good results in children.\n",
      "- Candida antigen. This method works by injecting candida antigen into a wart. It stimulates the immune system to fight warts, even those not close to the injection site. This is an off-label use of this medicine, which means that it doesn't have FDA approval for removing warts. This method is often used with good results for people whose warts haven't responded to other treatments.\n",
      "- Freezing. Freezing therapy administered at the office of a healthcare professional involves applying liquid nitrogen to a wart. This method also is called cryotherapy. It works by causing a blister to form under and around the wart, killing the tissue. The dead tissue sloughs off in a week or so. You'll likely need repeat treatments.\n",
      "Side effects of cryotherapy include pain, blistering and scarring. Because this technique can be painful, it usually isn't used to treat the warts of young children.\n",
      "- Other acids. If salicylic acid or freezing isn't working, your healthcare professional might suggest trichloroacetic acid or other acids. With this method, the wart is shaved and then the acid is applied with a wooden toothpick. You'll need repeat treatments every week or so until the wart goes away.\n",
      "Side effects are burning, stinging and changes in skin color.\n",
      "- Remove wart tissue. Your healthcare professional can use a special tool to remove part of the wart. This tool is called a curet. This treatment may be combined with other methods. The wart may return in the same area.\n",
      "- Laser treatment. If other methods haven't worked, your healthcare professional might suggest laser treatment. This type of treatment is also called photo-based therapy. Examples include carbon dioxide laser, pulsed-dye laser and photodynamic therapy. Laser treatment burns the tiny blood vessels in warts. Over time the wart dies and falls off.\n",

      "Currently, there isn't a specific test to diagnose Parkinson's disease. A diagnosis is made by a doctor trained in nervous system conditions, known as a neurologist. A diagnosis of Parkinson's is based on your medical history, a review of your symptoms, and a neurological and physical exam.\n",
      "It can take time to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Healthcare professionals may recommend regular follow-up appointments with neurologists trained in movement disorders to evaluate your condition and symptoms over time and diagnose Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "Your healthcare team may order some of these tests and procedures:\n",
      "- Physical and neurological exam. This includes taking your medical history and doing a neurological exam that tests your thinking and mental abilities, senses, coordination, and reflexes.\n",
      "- Blood and lab tests. These are used to rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms.\n",
      "- Imaging tests, such as an MRI, brain ultrasound and PET scan. These are used to rule out other conditions. They are not very helpful in diagnosing Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "- A specific single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan called a dopamine transporter (DAT) scan. This can help support the suspicion that you have Parkinson's disease and help identify different types of tremor. But it is your symptoms and the results of your neurological exam that determine your diagnosis. Most people do not require a DAT scan.\n",
      "- Genetic testing. This tests for gene changes if there is a known family history of Parkinson's disease or if you have early-onset disease.\n",
      "- A short, low-dose treatment of medicines. You may be given medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease to see if you get better. If your symptoms show significant improvement, this may help confirm your diagnosis. You must be given a sufficient dose to show the benefit, as getting low doses for a day or two isn't reliable.\n",
      "- Follow-up appointments. Regular appointments with neurologists trained in movement disorders may be needed over time to confirm a diagnosis.\n",
      "- Alpha-synuclein test. This test, also called an alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay, detects Parkinson's disease before symptoms begin. Alpha-synuclein clumps are a hallmark sign of Parkinson's disease. Healthcare professionals can test for this condition in the skin or spinal fluid.\n",
      "Alpha-synuclein is found in Lewy bodies. It forms clumps that the body can't break down. The clumps spread and damage brain cells.\n",
      "In a 2023 study, researchers tested the spinal fluid of more than 1,000 people to look for clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein. The test accurately identified people with Parkinson's disease 87.7% of the time. The test also was highly sensitive for detecting people at risk of Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "This study of the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay was the largest so far. Some researchers say the study may be a breakthrough for Parkinson's disease diagnosis, research and treatment trials. But larger studies are needed.\n",

You may be told to first wipe your genital area with an antiseptic pad and to collect the urine midstream. The process helps prevent the sample from being contaminated.\n",
      "- Growing urinary tract bacteria in a lab. Lab analysis of the urine is sometimes followed by a urine culture. This test tells your provider what bacteria are causing the infection. It can let your provider know which medications will be most effective.\n",
      "- Creating images of the urinary tract. Recurrent UTIs may be caused by a structural problem in the urinary tract. Your health care provider may order an ultrasound, a CT scan or MRI to look for this issue. A contrast dye may be used to highlight structures in your urinary tract.\n",
      "- Using a scope to see inside the bladder. If you have recurrent UTIs, your health care provider may perform a cystoscopy. The test involves using a long, thin tube with a lens, called a cystoscope, to see inside the urethra and bladder. The cystoscope is inserted in the urethra and passed through to the bladder.\n",

      "- Antidiarrheal medicines. Nonprescription medicines, such as loperamide (Imodium A-D), can help control diarrhea. A care professional also might prescribe a bile acid binder, such as cholestyramine (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid) or colesevelam (Welchol). Bile acid binders can cause bloating.\n",
      "- Anticholinergic medicines. Medicines such as dicyclomine (Bentyl) can help relieve painful bowel spasms. They are sometimes prescribed for people who have bouts of diarrhea. These medicines are generally safe but can cause constipation, dry mouth and blurred vision.\n",
      "- Tricyclic antidepressants. This type of medicine can help relieve depression, but it also blocks the activity of neurons that control the intestines. This may help reduce pain. If you have diarrhea and belly pain without depression, a healthcare professional may suggest a lower than typical dose of imipramine (Tofranil), desipramine (Norpramin) or nortriptyline (Pamelor). Side effects — which might be reduced if you take the medicine at bedtime — can include drowsiness, blurred vision, dizziness and dry mouth.\n",
      "- SSRI antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) or paroxetine (Paxil), may help if you are depressed and have pain and constipation.\n",

A needle inserted into your lower back removes a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the protective fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal column. Changes in this fluid can point to infection and inflammation in the brain. Sometimes samples of CSF can be tested to identify the cause. This may include testing for infection or the presence of antibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis.\n",
      "- Other lab tests. Samples of blood, urine or excretions from the back of the throat can be tested for viruses or other infectious agents.\n",
      "- Electroencephalogram (EEG). Electrodes attached to your scalp record the brain's electrical activity. Certain patterns may point to encephalitis.\n",
      "- Body imaging. Sometimes, autoimmune encephalitis may be triggered by an immune response to a tumor in the body. The tumor may be noncancerous or cancerous. Your healthcare professional may order imaging studies, such as ultrasound, MRI, CT or PET-CT scans. These scans may look at your chest, stomach area or pelvis to check for these tumors. If a mass is found, a small piece of it may be removed to study it in a lab. This is known as a biopsy.\n",

      "Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra).\n",
      "- Integrase inhibitors stop the action of a protein called integrase. HIV uses integrase to put its genetic material into CD4 T cells.\n",
      "Examples include bictegravir sodium-emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress), dolutegravir (Tivicay) and cabotegravir (Vocabria).\n",

      "- Below 5.7% is normal.\n",
      "- 5.7% to 6.4% is diagnosed as prediabetes.\n",
      "- 6.5% or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.\n",
      "If the A1C test isn't available, or if you have certain conditions that interfere with an A1C test, your health care provider may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes:\n",
      "Random blood sugar test. Blood sugar values are expressed in milligrams of sugar per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles of sugar per liter (mmol/L) of blood. Regardless of when you last ate, a level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher suggests diabetes, especially if you also have symptoms of diabetes, such as frequent urination and extreme thirst.\n",
      "Fasting blood sugar test. A blood sample is taken after you haven't eaten overnight. Results are interpreted as follows:\n",
      "- Less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is considered healthy.\n",

      "- 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests is diagnosed as diabetes.\n",
      "Oral glucose tolerance test. This test is less commonly used than the others, except during pregnancy. You'll need to not eat for a certain amount of time and then drink a sugary liquid at your health care provider's office. Blood sugar levels then are tested periodically for two hours. Results are interpreted as follows:\n",
      "- Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) after two hours is considered healthy.\n",

      "- Amsler grid test. An eye professional may use an Amsler grid to test the clarity of your central vision. You'll be asked if the lines of the grid seem faded, broken or distorted. Noting where the distortion is on the grid can help to understand the extent of retinal damage. If you have macular degeneration, you may be asked to use this test to self-monitor your condition at home.\n",
      "- Optical coherence tomography (OCT). This test is an excellent technique for capturing precise images of the retina. This can help diagnose epiretinal membranes, macular holes and macular swelling, called edema. It also can monitor the extent of age-related wet macular degeneration and how it's responding to treatment.\n",
      "- Fundus autofluorescence (FAF). FAF may be used to determine the stage of retinal diseases, including macular degeneration. FAF highlights a retinal pigment, called lipofuscin, that increases with retinal damage or dysfunction.\n",
      "- Fluorescein angiography. This test uses a dye that causes blood vessels in the retina to stand out under a special light. This helps to exactly identify closed blood vessels, leaking blood vessels, new irregular blood vessels and subtle changes in the back of the eye.\n",
      "- Indocyanine green angiography. This test uses a dye that lights up when exposed to infrared light. The resulting images show retinal blood vessels and the deeper, harder-to-see blood vessels behind the retina in a tissue called the choroid.\n",

      "Treatment of retinal disease may be complex and sometimes urgent. Options include:\n",
      "- Using a laser. Laser surgery can repair a retinal tear or hole. Your surgeon uses a laser to heat small pinpoints on the retina. This creates scarring that usually binds the retina to the underlying tissue. Immediate laser treatment of a new retinal tear can decrease the chance of it causing a retinal detachment.\n",
      "- Shrinking irregular blood vessels. Your eye doctor may use a technique called scatter laser photocoagulation to shrink irregular new blood vessels that are bleeding or threatening to bleed into the eye. This treatment may help people with diabetic retinopathy. Extensive use of this treatment may cause the loss of some side (peripheral) or night vision.\n",
      "- Freezing. In this process, called cryopexy (KRY-o-pek-see), your surgeon applies a freezing probe to the outside wall of the eye to treat a retinal tear. Intense cold reaches the inside of the eye and freezes the retina. The treated area will later scar and secure the retina to the eye wall.\n",
      "- Injecting air or gas into your eye. This technique, called pneumatic retinopexy (RET-ih-no-pek-see), is used to help repair certain types of retinal detachment. It can be used in combination with cryopexy or laser photocoagulation.\n",
      "- Indenting the surface of your eye. This surgery, called scleral (SKLAIR-ul) buckling, is used to repair a retinal detachment. Your surgeon sews a small piece of silicone material to the outside eye surface, called the sclera. This indents the sclera and relieves some of the force caused by the vitreous tugging on the retina and reattaches the retina. This technique may be used with other treatments.\n",
      "- Evacuating and replacing the fluid in the eye. In this procedure, called vitrectomy (vih-TREK-tuh-me), your surgeon removes the gel-like fluid that fills the inside of your eye, called the vitreous. Air, gas or liquid is then injected into the space.\n",
      "Vitrectomy may be used if bleeding or inflammation clouds the vitreous and blocks the surgeon's view of the retina. This technique may be part of the treatment for people with a retinal tear, diabetic retinopathy, a macular hole, epiretinal membrane, an infection, eye trauma or a retinal detachment.\n",
      "- Injecting medicine into the eye. Your eye doctor may suggest injecting medicine into the vitreous in the eye. This technique may be effective in treating people with wet macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy or broken blood vessels within the eye.\n",
      "- Implanting a retinal prosthesis. People who have severe vision loss or blindness owing to certain inherited retinal disease may need surgery. A tiny electrode chip is implanted in the retina that receives input from a video camera on a pair of eyeglasses. The electrode picks up and relays visual information that the damaged retina can no longer process.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "To diagnose epilepsy, your healthcare professional reviews your symptoms and medical history. You may have several tests to diagnose epilepsy and to detect the cause of seizures. They may include:\n",
      "- A neurological exam. This exam tests your behavior, movements, mental function and other areas. The exam helps diagnose epilepsy and determine the type of epilepsy you may have.\n",
      "- Blood tests. A blood sample can detect signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures.\n",
      "- Genetic testing. In some people with epilepsy, genetic testing may give more information about the condition and how to treat it. Genetic testing is most often performed in children but also may be helpful in some adults with epilepsy.\n",
      "You also may have brain imaging tests and scans that detect brain changes:\n",
      "- Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, small metal discs called electrodes are attached to your scalp with an adhesive or cap. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain.\n",
      "If you have epilepsy, it's common to have changes in the pattern of brain waves. These changes occur even when you're not having a seizure. Your healthcare professional may monitor you on video during an EEG to detect and record any seizures. This may be done while you're awake or asleep. Recording the seizures may help determine what kind of seizures you're having or rule out other conditions.\n",
      "The test may be done in a healthcare professional's office or the hospital. Or you may have an ambulatory EEG. The EEG records seizure activity over the course of a few days at home.\n",
      "You may get instructions to do something that can cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test.\n",
      "- High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, you may have a high-density EEG. For this test, electrodes are placed closer together compared with a conventional EEG. High-density EEG may help more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can detect tumors, bleeding or cysts in the brain that might be causing epilepsy.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of the brain. Like a CT scan, an MRI looks at the structure of the brain to detect what may be causing seizures. But an MRI provides a more detailed look at the brain than a CT scan.\n",
      "- Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of the brain are working. This test may be used before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement. This allows surgeons to avoid those areas while operating.\n",
      "- Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material. The material is injected into a vein to help visualize metabolic activity of the brain and detect changes. Areas of the brain with low metabolism may indicate places where seizures occur.\n",
      "- Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used if MRI and EEG didn't pinpoint the location in the brain where the seizures start.\n",
      "A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material. The material is injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3D map of blood flow during seizures. Areas of higher than typical blood flow may indicate areas where seizures occur.\n",
      "Another type of SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM) may provide even more-detailed results. The test overlaps the SPECT results with brain MRI results.\n",
      "- Neuropsychological tests. These tests assess thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help determine which areas of the brain are affected by seizures.\n",
      "Along with your test results, a combination of other techniques may be used to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start:\n",
      "- Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM looks at the areas of the brain with increased blood flow during seizures. It's compared to the same areas of the brains of people who don't have seizures. This provides information about where seizures begin.\n",
      "- Electrical source imaging (ESI). ESI is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain. This is done to show areas where seizures are occurring. This technique provides more-precise detail than does EEG alone.\n",
      "- Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity. This helps find the potential areas where seizures start. MEG can be more accurate than EEG because the skull and tissue surrounding the brain interfere less with magnetic fields. MEG and MRI together provide images that show areas of the brain both affected by seizures and not affected by seizures.\n",
      "Diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment can help people diagnosed with epilepsy have fewer seizures or even completely stop having seizures. Possible treatments include:\n",
      "- Medicines.\n",

      "- Blood tests. Blood tests are used to confirm an infection and to try to identify the type of organism causing the infection. However, precise identification isn't always possible.\n",
      "- Chest X-ray. This helps your doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the extent and location of the infection. However, it can't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.\n",
      "- Pulse oximetry. This measures the oxygen level in your blood. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.\n",
      "- Sputum test. A sample of fluid from your lungs (sputum) is taken after a deep cough and analyzed to help pinpoint the cause of the infection.\n",
      "Your doctor might order additional tests if you're older than age 65, are in the hospital, or have serious symptoms or health conditions. These may include:\n",
      "- CT scan. If your pneumonia isn't clearing as quickly as expected, your doctor may recommend a chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs.\n",

      "Specific treatments depend on the type and severity of your pneumonia, your age and your overall health. The options include:\n",
      "- Antibiotics. These medicines are used to treat bacterial pneumonia. It may take time to identify the type of bacteria causing your pneumonia and to choose the best antibiotic to treat it. If your symptoms don't improve, your doctor may recommend a different antibiotic.\n",
      "- Cough medicine. This medicine may be used to calm your cough so that you can rest. Because coughing helps loosen and move fluid from your lungs, it's a good idea not to eliminate your cough completely. In addition, you should know that very few studies have looked at whether over-the-counter cough medicines lessen coughing caused by pneumonia. If you want to try a cough suppressant, use the lowest dose that helps you rest.\n",

      "- Endoscopy. This test uses a long tube with a tiny camera that's put into your mouth and passed down your throat. The camera enables the practitioner to view your small intestine and take a small tissue sample, called a biopsy, to analyze for damage to the villi.\n",
      "- Capsule endoscopy. This test uses a tiny wireless camera to take pictures of your entire small intestine. The camera sits inside a vitamin-sized capsule, which you swallow. As the capsule travels through your digestive tract, the camera takes thousands of pictures that are transmitted to a recorder. This test is used in some situations where an exam of the entire or end of the small intestine is desired.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends chlamydia testing for anyone with chlamydia symptoms. Regardless of symptoms, talk to your healthcare team to find out how often you should be screened for chlamydia. In general, some groups are screened more often than others, such as:\n",
      "- Sexually active women age 25 or younger. The rate of chlamydia infection is highest in this group, so a yearly screening test is recommended. Even if you've been tested in the past year, get tested when you have a new sex partner.\n",
      "- Pregnant people. Chlamydia screening may be offered during the first prenatal exam. If you have a high risk of infection, get tested again later in your pregnancy. You are at high risk if you are younger than age 25, have a new sex partner or have a sex partner who might be infected.\n",
      "- People at high risk. People who have new or multiple sex partners or men who have sex with men should consider more frequent chlamydia screening. Other markers of high risk are current infection with another sexually transmitted infection and possible exposure to an STI through an infected partner.\n",
      "Screening and diagnosis of chlamydia is relatively simple. You may be able to use a test that's available without a prescription, sometimes called an at-home test, to see if you have chlamydia. If that test shows you have chlamydia, you'll need to see a healthcare professional to confirm the diagnosis and start treatment.\n",
      "To determine whether you have chlamydia, your healthcare professional will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected with:\n",
      "- A urine test. A sample of urine is analyzed in the laboratory for presence of this infection. This can be done for males and females.\n",
      "- A swab. A sample from the cervix, vagina, throat or anus is collected on a swab for testing. From the cervix, a member of your healthcare team collects a sample of the discharge from the cervix on a swab for testing. This can be done during a routine Pap test. For a swab from the vagina, either you or the healthcare professional can do the swab. For males and females, depending on sexual history, a swab may be taken from the throat or the anus.\n",

      "- Home sleep tests. Your health care provider might provide you with simplified tests to be used at home to diagnose sleep apnea. These tests usually measure your heart rate, blood oxygen level, airflow and breathing patterns. Your provider is more likely to recommend polysomnography in a sleep testing facility, rather than a home sleep test, if central sleep apnea is suspected.\n",
      "If the results aren't typical, your provider might be able to prescribe a therapy without further testing. Portable monitoring devices sometimes miss sleep apnea. So your health care provider might still recommend polysomnography even if your first results are within the standard range.\n",
      "If you have obstructive sleep apnea, your health care provider might refer you to an ear, nose and throat specialist to rule out a blockage in your nose or throat. An evaluation by a heart specialist, known as a cardiologist, or a doctor who specializes in the nervous system, called a neurologist, might be necessary to look for causes of central sleep apnea.\n",

      "You're likely to start by seeing your primary health care provider. If your provider suspects that you have a problem with alcohol, you may be referred to a mental health provider.\n",
      "To assess your problem with alcohol, your provider will likely:\n",
      "- Ask you some questions related to your drinking habits. The provider may ask for permission to speak with family members or friends. However, confidentiality laws prevent your provider from giving out any information about you without your consent.\n",
      "- Perform a physical exam. Your health care provider may do a physical exam and ask questions about your health. There are many physical signs that indicate complications of alcohol use.\n",
      "- Suggest lab tests and imaging tests. While there are no specific tests to diagnose alcohol use disorder, certain patterns of lab test results may strongly suggest it. And you may need tests to identify health problems that may be linked to your alcohol use. Damage to your organs may be seen on tests.\n",
      "- Complete a psychological evaluation. This evaluation includes questions about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to complete a questionnaire to help answer these questions.\n",

      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for alcohol use disorder can vary, depending on your needs. Treatment may involve a brief intervention, individual or group counseling, an outpatient program, or a residential inpatient stay. Working to stop alcohol use to improve quality of life is the main treatment goal.\n",
      "Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include:\n",
      "- Detox and withdrawal. Treatment may begin with a program of detoxification — withdrawal that's medically managed. Sometimes called detox, this generally takes 2 to 7 days. You may need to take sedating medications to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Detox is usually done at an inpatient treatment center or a hospital.\n",
      "- Learning new skills and making a treatment plan. This process usually involves alcohol treatment specialists. It may include goal setting, behavior change techniques, use of self-help manuals, counseling and follow-up care at a treatment center.\n",
      "- Psychological counseling. Counseling and therapy for groups and individuals help you better understand your problem with alcohol and support recovery from the psychological aspects of alcohol use. You may benefit from couples or family therapy — family support can be an important part of the recovery process.\n",
      "- Oral medications. A drug called disulfiram may help prevent you from drinking, although it won't cure alcohol use disorder or remove the urge to drink. If you drink alcohol while taking disulfiram, the drug produces a physical reaction that may include flushing, nausea, vomiting and headaches.\n",
      "Naltrexone, a drug that blocks the good feelings alcohol causes, may prevent heavy drinking and reduce the urge to drink. Acamprosate may help you combat alcohol cravings once you stop drinking. Unlike disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate don't make you feel sick after taking a drink.\n",
      "- Injected medication. Vivitrol, a version of the drug naltrexone, is injected once a month by a health care professional. Although similar medication can be taken in pill form, the injectable version of the drug may be easier for people recovering from alcohol use disorder to use consistently.\n",
      "- Continuing support. Aftercare programs and support groups help people recovering from alcohol use disorder to stop drinking, manage relapses and cope with necessary lifestyle changes. This may include medical or psychological care or attending a support group.\n",
      "- Treatment for psychological problems. Alcohol use disorder commonly occurs along with other mental health disorders. If you have depression, anxiety or another mental health condition, you may need talk therapy (psychotherapy), medications or other treatment.\n",
      "- Medical treatment for health conditions. Many alcohol-related health problems improve significantly once you stop drinking. But some health conditions may warrant continued treatment and follow-up care.\n",
      "- Spiritual practice. People who are involved with some type of regular spiritual practice may find it easier to maintain recovery from alcohol use disorder or other addictions. For many people, gaining greater insight into their spiritual side is a key element in recovery.\n",

      "- X-ray of the upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after drinking a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of the digestive tract. The coating allows a healthcare professional to see a silhouette of the esophagus and stomach. This is particularly useful for people who are having trouble swallowing.\n",
      "Sometimes, an X-ray is done after swallowing a barium pill. This can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that's interfering with swallowing.\n",

They can check the level of copper in your blood too. Your doctor also might want to measure the amount of copper removed in your urine during a 24-hour period.\n",
      "- Eye exam. Using a microscope with a high-intensity light, an eye doctor checks your eyes for Kayser-Fleischer rings. This is called a slit-lamp exam. These rings are caused by extra copper in the eyes. Wilson's disease also is related to a type of cataract, called a sunflower cataract. This cataract can be seen during an eye exam.\n",
      "- Removing a sample of liver tissue for testing, also known as a biopsy. In a biopsy, your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin and into your liver. Then your doctor draws a small sample of tissue. A laboratory tests the tissue for extra copper.\n",

      "- Laboratory tests for H. pylori. A blood, stool or breath test can show whether H. pylori is in your body.\n",
      "For the breath test, you drink or eat something that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori breaks down the substance in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you have H. pylori, your breath sample has the radioactive carbon in the form of carbon dioxide.\n",
      "If you take an antacid or an antibiotic, tell your healthcare professional. You may need to stop the medicine for a time. Both can affect test results.\n",
      "- Endoscopy. During this procedure, your healthcare professional uses a long, flexible tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope, to look at the upper part of your digestive system. Endoscopy involves passing the endoscope, down your throat and into your esophagus, stomach and small intestine to look for ulcers.\n",
      "If there's an ulcer, your health professional may remove a small tissue sample for study in a lab. This is called a biopsy. A biopsy also can show whether H. pylori is in your stomach lining.\n",
      "You're more likely to have endoscopy if you are older, have signs of bleeding, or have had recent weight loss or trouble eating and swallowing. If the endoscopy shows an ulcer in your stomach, you're likely to have a follow-up endoscopy after treatment. This can show if the ulcer has healed.\n",
      "- Upper gastrointestinal series. Sometimes called a barium swallow, this series of X-rays of the upper digestive system makes pictures of your esophagus, stomach and small intestine. During the series of X-rays, you swallow a white liquid that has barium. The liquid coats your digestive tract and makes an ulcer easier to see.\n",

      "- Antibiotics to kill H. pylori. If you have H. pylori in your digestive tract, your healthcare professional may suggest a mix of antibiotics. These may include amoxicillin (Amoxil, Larotid), clarithromycin (Biaxin XL), metronidazole (Flagyl, Likmez), tinidazole (Tindamax), tetracycline and levofloxacin.\n",
      "- Medicines that block acid. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce stomach acid. PPIs include omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium) and pantoprazole (Protonix).\n",
      "Most people take PPIs in pill form. In the hospital, treatment for a bleeding ulcer may involve a PPI given through a vein in the arm. This is known as intravenous delivery.\n",
      "Long-term or high-dose use of proton pump inhibitors may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture. Ask your healthcare professional whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk.\n",

      "- Pelvic exam. Your health care professional feels areas in your pelvis with one or two gloved fingers to check for any unusual changes. These changes can include cysts on the reproductive organs, painful spots, irregular growths called nodules and scars behind the uterus. Often, small areas of endometriosis can't be felt unless a cyst has formed.\n",
      "- Ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body. To capture the images, a device called a transducer might be pressed against the stomach area. Or it may be placed into the vagina in a version of the exam called transvaginal ultrasound. Both types of the test may be done to get the best view of the reproductive organs. A standard ultrasound won't confirm whether you have endometriosis. But it can find cysts linked with the condition called endometriomas.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This exam uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make images of the organs and tissues within the body. For some, an MRI helps with surgical planning. It gives your surgeon detailed information about the location and size of endometriosis growths.\n",
      "- Laparoscopy. In some cases, you may be referred to a surgeon for this procedure. Laparoscopy lets the surgeon check inside your abdomen for signs of endometriosis tissue. Before the surgery, you receive medicine that puts you a sleep-like state and prevents pain. Then your surgeon makes a tiny cut near your navel and inserts a slender viewing instrument called a laparoscope.\n",
      "A laparoscopy can provide information about the location, extent and size of the endometriosis growths. Your surgeon may take a tissue sample called biopsy for more testing. With proper planning, a surgeon can often treat endometriosis during the laparoscopy so that you need only one surgery.\n",

The blood cells are then put back into your body, which makes more plasma to replace what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.\n",
      "- Immunoglobulin therapy. Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein. High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome.\n",

      "- Overnight oximetry test. Using a small monitor that attaches to a finger, this test measures heart rate and oxygen levels in the blood throughout the night. Drops in oxygen levels while sleeping may happen with sleep apnea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment depends on the type of sleep disorder you have and how much your symptoms affect your daily life. Treatment options may include:\n",
      "- Healthy-lifestyle choices. These can include losing weight if needed, following good sleep habits, getting regular physical activity, cutting back on alcohol and caffeine near bedtime, and avoiding recreational drugs.\n",
      "- Treatment of other health conditions. Treating medical and mental health conditions that may be causing or adding to sleep disorders may improve sleep.\n",
      "- Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). CBT-I involves looking at thoughts and behaviors that interfere with sleep. With guidance, you can create a plan for getting better rest. This may include finding ways to relax at bedtime, going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day, and not taking naps.\n",
      "- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. This is the standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. You use a CPAP machine to treat obstructive sleep apnea whenever you're sleeping. The machine has a hose that connects to a mask. You wear the mask over your face or nose. The machine provides airflow at a pressure that holds your airway open during sleep.\n",
      "A type of CPAP called bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) may be used in obstructive sleep apnea for people who can't tolerate CPAP. BPAP also may be used to help breathing in people who have conditions that keep their breathing muscles from working as they should.\n",
      "- Oral appliances. Appliances worn in the mouth, known as oral appliances, may be an option instead of CPAP. These are custom-made mouthpieces that are used during sleep. The goal is to lessen airflow blockage in the throat area by pushing the lower jaw and tongue forward.\n",
      "- Surgeries. Another option instead of CPAP is surgery. There are different surgical options designed to lessen airflow blockage during sleep. These include surgeries on the nose or jaws and surgeries to reduce upper airway soft tissue.\n",
      "A newer surgical option for obstructive sleep apnea is upper airway nerve stimulation therapy. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has approved an upper airway nerve stimulation system called Inspire to treat obstructive sleep apnea in some people if CPAP therapy doesn't work.\n",
      "Surgery is needed to place the Inspire system. A small device called a generator is placed under the skin on the upper chest. When the breathing muscles don't move, the device sends a pulse to the nerve under the tongue. This causes the tongue to move forward, opening the airway.\n",
      "- Medicines. Medicines and supplements may help treat some sleep disorders.\n",

      "Tests most often aren't needed to diagnose menopause. But sometimes, your healthcare professional may suggest blood tests to check your levels of:\n",
      "- Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen (estradiol). FSH goes up and estrogen goes down during menopause. Because hormones go up and down during perimenopause, it can be hard to tell from these tests whether you're in menopause.\n",
      "- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Overactive thyroid, called hyperthyroidism, can cause symptoms like those of menopause.\n",
      "You can get home tests to check FSH levels in your urine without a prescription. The tests show whether you have higher FSH levels. This might mean that you're in perimenopause or menopause.\n",
      "But FSH levels rise and fall during your menstrual cycle. So home FSH tests can't really tell you whether you're in menopause.\n",

      "Treatment:\n",
      "Menopause needs no treatment. Treatments aim to ease symptoms and prevent or manage ongoing conditions that may happen with aging. Treatments may include:\n",
      "- Hormone therapy. Estrogen therapy works best for easing menopausal hot flashes. It also eases other menopause symptoms and slows bone loss.\n",
      "Your healthcare professional may suggest estrogen in the lowest dose and for the time needed to relieve your symptoms. It's best used by people who are younger than 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause.\n",
      "If you still have your uterus, you'll need progestin with estrogen. Estrogen also helps prevent bone loss.\n",
      "Long-term use of hormone therapy may have some heart disease and breast cancer risks. But starting hormones around the time of menopause has shown benefits for some people. Talk with your healthcare professional about whether hormone therapy may be safe for you.\n",
      "- Vaginal estrogen. To relieve vaginal dryness, you can apply estrogen to the vagina using a vaginal cream, tablet or ring. This treatment gives you a small amount of estrogen, which the vaginal tissues take in. It can help ease vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse and some urinary symptoms.\n",
      "- Prasterone (Intrarosa). You put this human-made hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) into the vagina. It helps ease vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse.\n",
      "- Low-dose medicines to treat depression, called antidepressants. Some antidepressants may ease menopausal hot flashes. These are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI). A low-dose antidepressant may help manage hot flashes in people who can't take estrogen for health reasons or for those who need an antidepressant for a mood disorder.\n",
      "- Gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin). Gabapentin is approved to treat seizures, but it also has been shown to help reduce hot flashes. This medicine is useful for people who can't use estrogen therapy and for those who also have nighttime hot flashes.\n",
      "- Clonidine (Catapres-TTS-1, Nexiclon XR). This pill or patch most often treats high blood pressure. It might give some relief from hot flashes. It's not often prescribed for hot flashes because of the possible side effects, such as low blood pressure, headache, sleepiness and constipation.\n",
      "- Fezolinetant (Veozah). This medicine is free of hormones. It treats menopause hot flashes by blocking a pathway in the brain that helps manage body temperature. It's FDA approved for managing menopause symptoms. It can cause abdominal pain, liver problems and make sleep problems worse.\n",
      "- Oxybutynin (Oxytrol). This medicine treats overactive bladder and urinary urge incontinence. It's also been shown to relieve menopause symptoms. But in older adults, it may be linked to cognitive decline.\n",
      "- Medicines to prevent or treat the bone-thinning condition called osteoporosis. Your healthcare professional might suggest medicine to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Several medicines can help reduce bone loss and risk of fractures. Your healthcare professional also might prescribe vitamin D supplements to help strengthen bones.\n",
      "- Ospemifene (Osphena). Taken by mouth, this selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) medicine treats painful intercourse linked to the thinning of vaginal tissue. This medicine isn't for people who have had breast cancer or who are at high risk of breast cancer.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Moyamoya disease is usually diagnosed by a neurologist who specializes in the condition. The specialist will review your symptoms and your family and medical history. The specialist also will likely perform a physical exam. Several tests are generally needed to diagnose moyamoya disease and any underlying conditions.\n",
      "Tests may include:\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. A health care provider may inject a dye into a blood vessel to view your arteries and veins and highlight blood circulation. This type of test is called a magnetic resonance angiogram.\n",
      "Your neurologist may recommend a perfusion MRI if available. This type of imaging can measure the amount of blood passing through the vessels. It can show the extent of reduction of blood supply to the brain.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of your brain.  A health care provider may inject a dye into a blood vessel to highlight blood flow in your arteries and veins. This is called a (CT angiogram). This test can't diagnose early stages of moyamoya disease. But it may be helpful in identifying problems with blood vessels.\n",
      "- Cerebral angiogram. In a cerebral angiogram, a health care provider inserts a long, thin tube called a catheter into a blood vessel in your groin. The provider then guides it to your brain using X-ray imaging. The provider injects dye through the catheter into the blood vessels of your brain. The contrast conforms to the shape of the blood vessels to make them more visible under X-ray imaging.\n",
      "- Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). In these tests, you're injected with a small amount of a safe radioactive material.   PET provides visual images of brain activity. SPECT measures blood flow to regions of the brain.\n",
      "- Electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG monitors the electrical activity in your brain using small metal discs called electrodes attached to your scalp. Children with moyamoya disease often have EEG results that aren't typical.\n",
      "- Transcranial Doppler ultrasound. In surgical transcranial Doppler ultrasound, sound waves are used to obtain images of your head and sometimes your neck. Specialists may use this test to evaluate blood flow in blood vessels in your neck.\n",
      "If necessary, your neurologist may order other tests to rule out other conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Health care providers evaluate your condition and determine the most appropriate treatment. Treatment doesn't cure moyamoya disease. But treatment can be effective in preventing strokes.\n",
      "The goal of treatment is to reduce your symptoms and improve brain blood flow. Treatment also aims to lower your risk of complications. Complications include ischemic stroke caused by a lack of blood flow, bleeding in your brain and death.\n",
      "The prognosis for moyamoya disease depends on several factors, including:\n",
      "- How early the disease was diagnosed.\n",
      "- How much damage has occurred when you seek treatment.\n",

      "A variety of medicines are used to treat adult Still disease. The type of medicine depends on how bad the symptoms are and possible side effects.\n",
      "- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), may help with mild joint pain and inflammation. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Since NSAIDs can damage the liver, regular blood tests may be needed to check liver function.\n",
      "- Steroids. Many people who have adult Still disease require treatment with steroids, such as prednisone. These powerful drugs reduce inflammation. They may lower the body's resistance to infections and increase the risk of developing osteoporosis and diabetes.\n",
      "- Methotrexate. The medicine methotrexate (Trexall) is often used in combination with prednisone. The prednisone dose is reduced when combined with methotrexate.\n",
      "- Biologic response modifiers. If other medicines haven't worked, your health care provider may recommend a biologic response modifier. Biologic response modifiers are medicines that block proteins causing inflammation. These medicines are often referred to as biologics. Anakinra (Kineret), canakinumab (Ilaris) and tocilizumab (Actemra) are some biologics that are used to treat adult Still disease.

      "- Blood test. This test can measure blood levels of sodium, potassium, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A blood test also can measure proteins called antibodies related to Addison's disease caused by an autoimmune disease.\n",
      "- ACTH stimulation test. ACTH tells the adrenal glands to make cortisol. This test measures the level of cortisol in the blood before and after a shot of lab-made ACTH.\n",
      "- Insulin-induced hypoglycemia test. This test is done to find out if the pituitary gland is causing secondary adrenal insufficiency. The test involves checking blood sugar and cortisol levels after a shot of insulin.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. A CT scan of the stomach area checks the size of the adrenal glands and looks for other issues. An MRI of the pituitary gland can spot damage that may cause secondary adrenal insufficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Addison's disease treatment involves taking medicines to correct the levels of steroid hormones that the body isn't making enough of. Some treatments include corticosteroid medicines taken by mouth such as:\n",
      "- Hydrocortisone (Cortef), prednisone (Rayos, Prednisone Intensol) or methylprednisolone (Medrol) to replace cortisol. You take these medicines on a schedule. This helps mimic the changes in cortisol levels the body typically goes through over 24 hours.\n",
      "- Fludrocortisone acetate to replace aldosterone.\n",
      "You'll likely need plenty of sodium in your diet. This is especially true during heavy exercise and when the weather is hot. It's also true if you have digestive troubles such as diarrhea.\n",
      "Your healthcare professional may tell you to raise the dose of your medicine for a short time if your body is stressed. Such stress can come from having surgery, an infection or a minor illness. If you're vomiting and can't keep down your medicine, you may need shots of corticosteroids.\n",
      "Follow these treatment recommendations as well:\n",
      "- Carry a medical alert card and bracelet at all times. A steroid emergency card and medical alert bracelet or tag let emergency care professionals know what kind of care you need. Also have a written action plan.\n",
      "- Keep extra medicine handy. It can be dangerous to miss even one day of medicine. So keep a small supply at work and take extra medicine with you when you travel.\n",
      "- Carry a corticosteroid medicine injection kit. The kit contains a needle, a syringe and an injectable form of corticosteroids to use in case of emergency.\n",
      "- Stay in contact with your healthcare professional. Your healthcare team can monitor your hormone levels. If you have trouble with your medicine, your healthcare professional may need to change the doses or when you take them.\n",
      "- Have yearly checkups. At least once a year, see your healthcare professional or a doctor who treats hormone conditions. Your healthcare professional may recommend yearly screening tests for autoimmune diseases.\n",

Blood sugar values are expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L). No matter when you last ate, a random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher suggests diabetes.\n",
      "- Fasting blood sugar test. A blood sample will be taken after you don't eat (fast) overnight. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is healthy. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it's 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.\n",
      "If you're diagnosed with diabetes, your provider may also run blood tests. These will check for autoantibodies that are common in type 1 diabetes. The tests help your provider decide between type 1 and type 2 diabetes when the diagnosis isn't certain.

A long tube with a camera is fed through the mouth and digestive system to the bile duct. This tube also is used to get tiny tools to the site to remove the stone and clear the bile duct. ERCP may itself trigger acute pancreatitis, but research about risk factors have helped improve outcomes.\n",
      "- Gallbladder surgery. If gallstones caused the pancreatitis, surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended. This procedure is called a cholecystectomy.\n",
      "- Pancreas procedures. Procedures with an endoscopic camera and tools may be used to drain fluid from the pancreas or remove diseased tissue.\n",
      "- Treatment for alcohol dependence. If excessive alcohol use has caused pancreatitis, a treatment program for alcohol addiction is recommended. Continuing to drink alcohol worsens pancreatitis and leads to serious complications.\n",

An MRI can reveal spinal cord tumors, herniated disks in the neck or other conditions that might be causing your symptoms. The highest resolution cameras may sometimes see ALS changes themselves.\n",
      "- Blood and urine tests. Analyzing samples of your blood and urine in the laboratory might help eliminate other possible causes of your symptoms. Serum neurofilament light levels, which are measured from blood samples, are generally high in people with ALS. The test can help make a diagnosis early in the disease.\n",
      "- Spinal tap, known as a lumbar puncture. This involves removing a sample of spinal fluid for laboratory testing. Spinal fluid is removed using a small needle inserted between two bones in the lower back. The spinal fluid appears typical in people with ALS but may uncover another cause of symptoms.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "To confirm that your child has Tay-Sachs disease, your health care provider will ask about symptoms and any family hereditary disorders, and also do a physical exam. Your child may need to see a neurologist and an ophthalmologist for nervous system and eye examinations.\n",
      "Your health care provider may order the following tests:\n",
      "- Diagnostic blood test. The blood test checks the levels of hexosaminidase A enzyme in the blood. The levels are low or absent in Tay-Sachs disease.\n",
      "- Genetic testing. This test can examine the HEXA gene to identify whether there are changes that indicate Tay-Sachs disease.\n",
      "- Eye exam. During an eye exam, the health care provider may see a cherry-red spot in the back of the eyes, which is a sign of the disease.\n",
      "Prenatal testing for Tay-Sachs disease can be done during pregnancy by removing a tiny piece of the placenta (chorionic villi sampling) or by removing a small sample of the amniotic fluid around the baby (amniocentesis).\n",

      "Supportive treatments include:\n",
      "- Medication. A number of prescription medications are available to reduce symptoms and prevent complications: for example, anti-seizure medications or antibiotics for infection.\n",
      "- Respiratory care. Accumulated mucus in the lungs is common and results in a high risk of lung infections that cause breathing problems. Chest physiotherapy (CPT), exercise and other techniques can help remove mucus from the lungs. Medications to reduce saliva production and positioning techniques are also options to reduce the risk of mucus accumulation and prevent aspiration pneumonia.\n",
      "- Nutrition and hydration. Your child may have trouble swallowing or develop respiratory problems by inhaling food or liquid into the lungs while eating. To prevent those problems, your doctor may recommend an assistive feeding device such as a feeding tube. A feeding tube may be inserted through your child's nose and into the stomach, or a surgeon may surgically insert a feeding tube directly into the stomach (gastrostomy tube).\n",
      "- Physical therapy. As the disease progresses, your child may benefit from physical therapy to help keep joints flexible and maintain as much ability to move (range of motion) as possible. Physical therapy may delay joint stiffness and reduce or delay the loss of function and pain that can result from affected muscles.\n",
      "- Occupational therapy. These therapists can recommend activities and supportive devices to help with daily functioning.\n",

Pockets are measured at several places in your upper and lower gums. In a healthy mouth, the pocket depth is usually between 1 and 3 millimeters (mm). Pockets deeper than 4 mm may indicate periodontitis. Pockets deeper than 5 mm cannot be cleaned well with routine care.\n",
      "- Take dental X-rays to check for bone loss in areas where your dentist sees deeper pockets.\n",

If your child shows any symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, you'll likely be referred to a specialist who treats children with autism spectrum disorder, such as a child psychiatrist or psychologist, pediatric neurologist, or developmental pediatrician, for an evaluation.\n",
      "Because autism spectrum disorder varies widely in symptoms and severity, making a diagnosis may be difficult. There isn't a specific medical test to determine the disorder. Instead, a specialist may:\n",
      "- Observe your child and ask how your child's social interactions, communication skills and behavior have developed and changed over time\n",
      "- Give your child tests covering hearing, speech, language, developmental level, and social and behavioral issues\n",

Early intervention during the preschool years can help your child learn critical social, communication, functional and behavioral skills.\n",
      "The range of home-based and school-based treatments and interventions for autism spectrum disorder can be overwhelming, and your child's needs may change over time. Your health care provider can recommend options and help identify resources in your area.\n",
      "If your child is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, talk to experts about creating a treatment strategy and build a team of professionals to meet your child's needs.\n",
      "Treatment options may include:\n",
      "- Behavior and communication therapies. Many programs address the range of social, language and behavioral difficulties associated with autism spectrum disorder. Some programs focus on reducing problem behaviors and teaching new skills. Other programs focus on teaching children how to act in social situations or communicate better with others. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) can help children learn new skills and generalize these skills to multiple situations through a reward-based motivation system.\n",
      "- Educational therapies. Children with autism spectrum disorder often respond well to highly structured educational programs. Successful programs typically include a team of specialists and a variety of activities to improve social skills, communication and behavior. Preschool children who receive intensive, individualized behavioral interventions often show good progress.\n",
      "- Family therapies. Parents and other family members can learn how to play and interact with their children in ways that promote social interaction skills, manage problem behaviors, and teach daily living skills and communication.\n",
      "- Other therapies. Depending on your child's needs, speech therapy to improve communication skills, occupational therapy to teach activities of daily living, and physical therapy to improve movement and balance may be beneficial. A psychologist can recommend ways to address problem behavior.\n",
      "- Medications. No medication can improve the core signs of autism spectrum disorder, but specific medications can help control symptoms. For example, certain medications may be prescribed if your child is hyperactive; antipsychotic drugs are sometimes used to treat severe behavioral problems; and antidepressants may be prescribed for anxiety. Keep all health care providers updated on any medications or supplements your child is taking. Some medications and supplements can interact, causing dangerous side effects.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "There's no perfect test used to confirm or rule out a food allergy. Your healthcare team will consider a few factors before making a diagnosis. These factors include:\n",
      "- Your symptoms. Give your care team a detailed history of your or your child's symptoms — which foods, and how much, seem to cause problems.\n",
      "- Your family history of allergies. Also share information about members of your family who have allergies of any kind.\n",
      "- A physical examination. A careful exam can often identify or exclude other medical problems.\n",
      "- A skin test. A skin prick test can determine whether you may react to a particular food. In this test, a small amount of the suspected food is placed on the skin of your forearm or back. A doctor or another healthcare professional then pricks your skin to allow a tiny amount of the substance beneath your skin surface.\n",
      "If you're allergic to a particular substance being tested, you develop a raised bump or reaction. However, a positive reaction to this test alone isn't enough to confirm a food allergy.\n",
      "- A blood test. A blood test can measure your immune system's response to particular foods by measuring the allergy-related antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE).\n",
      "For this test, a blood sample taken in your care professional's office is sent to a medical laboratory. It will then be tested for foods that could have caused an allergic reaction.\n",
      "- Elimination diet. You may be asked to eliminate suspect foods for a week or two and then add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to specific foods. However, elimination diets aren't foolproof.\n",
      "An elimination diet can't tell you whether your reaction to a food is a true allergy instead of a food sensitivity. Also, if you've had a severe reaction to a food in the past, an elimination diet may not be safe.\n",
      "- Oral food challenge. During this test, done in a healthcare professional's office, you'll be given small but increasing amounts of the food suspected of causing your symptoms. If you don't have a reaction during this test, you may be able to include this food in your diet again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "One way to avoid an allergic reaction is to avoid the foods that cause symptoms. However, despite your best efforts, you may come into contact with a food that causes a reaction.\n",
      "For a minor allergic reaction, prescribed antihistamines or those available without a prescription may help reduce symptoms. These drugs can be taken after exposure to an allergy-causing food to help relieve itching or hives. However, antihistamines can't treat a severe allergic reaction.\n",
      "For a severe allergic reaction, you may need an emergency injection of epinephrine and a trip to the emergency room. Many people with allergies carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Adrenaclick, EpiPen). This device is a combined syringe and concealed needle that injects a single dose of medicine when pressed against your thigh.\n",
      "If you've been prescribed an epinephrine autoinjector:\n",
      "- Be sure you know how to use the autoinjector. Also, make sure the people closest to you know how to give the drug — if they're with you in an anaphylactic emergency, they could save your life.\n",
      "- Carry it with you at all times. It may be a good idea to keep an extra autoinjector in your car or in your desk at work.\n",

      "- Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show if there are signs of pneumonia.\n",
      "- Viral testing. A sample of mucus from your child's nose can be used to test for the virus causing bronchiolitis. This is done using a swab that's gently inserted into the nose.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Occasionally, blood tests might be used to check your child's white blood cell count. An increase in white blood cells is usually a sign that the body is fighting an infection. A blood test also can show if the level of oxygen in your child's bloodstream is low.\n",
      "Your child's provider may look for symptoms of dehydration, especially if your child has been refusing to drink or eat or has been vomiting. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth and skin, extreme tiredness, and making little or no urine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Bronchiolitis usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks but symptoms occasionally last longer. Most children with bronchiolitis can be cared for at home with comfort measures. It's important to be alert for problems with breathing that are getting worse. For example, struggling for each breath, not being able to speak or cry because of struggling to breathe, or making grunting noises with each breath.\n",
      "Because viruses cause bronchiolitis, antibiotics — which are used to treat infections caused by bacteria — don't work against viruses. Bacterial infections such as pneumonia or an ear infection can happen along with bronchiolitis. In this case, your child's health care provider may give an antibiotic for the bacterial infection.\n",
      "Medicines called bronchodilators that open the airways don't seem to help bronchiolitis, so they usually aren't given. In severe cases, your child's health care provider may try a nebulized albuterol treatment to see if it helps. During this treatment, a machine creates a fine mist of medicine that your child breathes into the lungs.\n",
      "Oral corticosteroid medicines and pounding on the chest to loosen mucus, a treatment called chest physiotherapy, have not been shown to be effective for bronchiolitis and are not recommended.\n",

      "- Blood tests. Blood tests can show how well the liver works. A prothrombin time test measures how long it takes blood to clot. With acute liver failure, blood doesn't clot as quickly as it should.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. A healthcare professional may recommend an ultrasound exam to look at the liver. Such testing may show liver damage and help find the cause of the liver problems. A health professional also may recommend abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the liver and blood vessels. These tests can look for certain causes of acute liver failure, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome or tumors. They may be used if a problem is suspected and ultrasound testing does not find the problem.\n",
      "- Examination of liver tissue. A healthcare professional may recommend removing a small piece of liver tissue, called a liver biopsy. Doing so may help discover why the liver is failing.\n",
      "Since people with acute liver failure are at risk of bleeding during biopsy, a transjugular liver biopsy may be performed. This procedure involves making a tiny incision on the right side of the neck. A thin tube called a catheter is then inserted into a neck vein, through the heart and into a vein exiting the liver. A needle is then threaded through the catheter to retrieve a sample of liver tissue.\n",

      "Acute liver failure treatments may include:\n",
      "- Medicines to reverse poisoning. Acute liver failure caused by acetaminophen overdose is treated with a medicine called acetylcysteine. This medicine also may help treat other causes of acute liver failure. Mushroom and other poisonings also may be treated with medicines that can reverse the effects of the toxin and may reduce liver damage.\n",

      "- Relieving pressure caused by excess fluid in the brain. Cerebral edema caused by acute liver failure can increase pressure on the brain. Medicines can help reduce the fluid buildup in your brain.\n",
      "- Screening for infections. Your medical team may take samples of your blood and urine every now and then to be tested for infection. If your team suspects that you have an infection, you'll receive medicines to treat the infection.\n",
      "- Preventing severe bleeding. Your care team can give you medicines to reduce the risk of bleeding. If you lose a lot of blood, tests may be done to find the source of the blood loss. Blood transfusions may be needed.\n",
      "- Providing nutritional support. If you're not able to eat, you may need supplements to treat nutritional deficiencies.\n",

      "Healthcare professionals in the emergency room do an exam, test for sensory function and movement, and ask questions about the accident. They may be able to rule out a spinal cord injury based on this evaluation.\n",
      "But emergency diagnostic tests may be needed. They should be done if the injured person has neck pain, isn't fully awake, or has obvious weakness or neurological injury.\n",
      "These tests can include:\n",
      "- X-rays. X-rays can reveal damage to the bone surrounding the spinal cord, known as the vertebrae. They also can find tumors, fractures or changes in the spine.\n",
      "- CT scan. A CT scan can provide a clearer image compared with an X-ray. This scan uses computers to form a series of cross-sectional images that can define bone, disk and other changes.\n",
      "- MRI. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce computer-generated images. This test is helpful for looking at the spinal cord to find herniated disks, blood clots or other masses that might compress the spinal cord.\n",
      "A few days after the injury, when some of the swelling might have gone down, a more comprehensive neurological exam may be done. The exam looks at the level and completeness of the injury. This involves testing muscle strength and your ability to sense light touch and pinprick sensations.\n",

      "A blood test to check cholesterol levels — called a lipid panel or lipid profile — typically reports:\n",
      "- Total cholesterol\n",
      "- LDL cholesterol\n",
      "- HDL cholesterol\n",
      "- Triglycerides — a type of fat in the blood\n",
      "Generally you're required to fast, consuming no food or liquids other than water, for nine to 12 hours before the test. Some cholesterol tests don't require fasting, so follow your doctor's instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Lifestyle changes such as exercising and eating a healthy diet are the first line of defense against high cholesterol. But, if you've made these important lifestyle changes and your cholesterol levels remain high, your doctor might recommend medication.\n",
      "The choice of medication or combination of medications depends on various factors, including your personal risk factors, your age, your health and possible drug side effects. Common choices include:\n",
      "- Statins. Statins block a substance your liver needs to make cholesterol. This causes your liver to remove cholesterol from your blood. Choices include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor).\n",
      "- Cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Your small intestine absorbs the cholesterol from your diet and releases it into your bloodstream. The drug ezetimibe (Zetia) helps reduce blood cholesterol by limiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Ezetimibe can be used with a statin drug.\n",
      "- Bempedoic acid. This newer drug works in much the same way as statins but is less likely to cause muscle pain. Adding bempedoic acid (Nexletol) to a maximum statin dosage can help lower LDL significantly. A combination pill containing both bempedoic acid and ezetimibe (Nexlizet) also is available.\n",
      "- Bile-acid-binding resins. Your liver uses cholesterol to make bile acids, a substance needed for digestion. The medications cholestyramine (Prevalite), colesevelam (Welchol) and colestipol (Colestid) lower cholesterol indirectly by binding to bile acids. This prompts your liver to use excess cholesterol to make more bile acids, which reduces the level of cholesterol in your blood.\n",
      "- PCSK9 inhibitors. These drugs can help the liver absorb more LDL cholesterol, which lowers the amount of cholesterol circulating in your blood. Alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) might be used for people who have a genetic condition that causes very high levels of LDL or in people with a history of coronary disease who have intolerance to statins or other cholesterol medications. They are injected under the skin every few weeks and are expensive.\n",

      "- Imaging tests. Tests, such as ultrasound or CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, may help determine the size, shape and structure of your ovaries.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Blood tests might include organ function tests that can help determine your overall health.\n",
      "Your doctor might also test your blood for tumor markers that indicate ovarian cancer. For example, a cancer antigen (CA) 125 test can detect a protein that's often found on the surface of ovarian cancer cells. These tests can't tell your doctor whether you have cancer, but they may provide clues about your diagnosis and prognosis.\n",
      "- Surgery. Sometimes your doctor can't be certain of your diagnosis until you undergo surgery to remove an ovary and have it tested for signs of cancer.\n",
      "- Genetic testing. Your doctor may recommend testing a sample of your blood to look for gene changes that increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Knowing you have an inherited change in your DNA helps your doctor make decisions about your treatment plan. You may wish to share the information with your blood relatives, such as your siblings and your children, since they also may have a risk of having those same gene changes.\n",
      "Once it's confirmed that you have ovarian cancer, your doctor will use information from your tests and procedures to assign your cancer a stage. The stages of ovarian cancer range from 1 to 4, which are often indicated with Roman numerals I to IV. The lowest stage indicates that the cancer is confined to the ovaries. By stage 4, the cancer has spread to distant areas of the body.\n",

      "- Physical exam. A health care provider looks in your ear for possible causes of your hearing loss, such as earwax or an infection. The way your ear is formed might cause hearing problems, as well.\n",
      "- Screening tests. A whisper test, which involves covering one ear at a time while listening to words spoken at many volumes, can show how you react to other sounds.\n",
      "- App-based hearing tests. You can use a mobile app on your tablet to screen yourself for hearing loss.\n",
      "- Tuning fork tests. Tuning forks are two-pronged, metal instruments that make sounds when hit. Simple tests with tuning forks can help find hearing loss. They may also show where the ear damage is.\n",
      "- Audiometer tests. A specialist in hearing loss, known as an audiologist, does these more-thorough tests. Sounds and words are directed through earphones to each ear. Each tone is repeated at low levels to find the quietest sound you can hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "You can get help for hearing problems. Treatment depends on the cause of the hearing loss and how bad it is.\n",

      "- Removing earwax. Earwax blockage is a cause of hearing loss that can be fixed. A health care provider might remove earwax using suction or a small tool with a loop on the end.\n",
      "- Surgery. Some types of hearing loss can be treated with surgery. For repeated infections that cause fluid in the ear, a care provider might put in small tubes that help ears drain.\n",
      "- Hearing aids. If hearing loss is from damage to the inner ear, a hearing aid can be helpful. A hearing specialist, known as an audiologist, can talk about how hearing aids can help and what kinds there are. Audiologists also can fit you with a hearing aid.\n",
      "- Cochlear implants. When a regular hearing aid isn't likely to help much, a cochlear implant might be an option. A cochlear implant isn't like a hearing aid that makes sound stronger and directs it into the ear canal. Instead, a cochlear implant goes around the parts of the inner ear that don't work to spur the hearing nerve.\n",

      "Regular checkups can find cavities and other dental issues before they lead to more-serious problems. The sooner you seek care, the better your chances of reversing the earliest stages of tooth decay and stopping it from getting worse. If a cavity is treated before it starts causing pain, you probably won't need a lot of treatment.\n",
      "Treatment of cavities depends on how serious they are and your situation. Treatment options include:\n",
      "- Fluoride treatments. If your cavity just started, a fluoride treatment may help restore your tooth's enamel and can sometimes reverse a cavity in the very early stages. Professional fluoride treatments contain more fluoride than the amount found in tap water, toothpaste and mouth rinses. Fluoride treatments may be liquid, gel, foam or varnish that's brushed onto your teeth or placed in a small tray that fits over your teeth.\n",
      "- Fillings. Fillings, also called restorations, are the main treatment option. Fillings are made of various materials, such as tooth-colored composite resin or porcelain, or dental amalgam that is a mixture of several materials.\n",
      "- Crowns. If you have a lot of decay or weakened teeth, you may need a crown — a custom-fitted covering that replaces your tooth's entire natural crown. The crown helps protect the soundness of the tooth and lowers the risk of fracture. Your dentist drills away the decayed area and enough of the rest of your tooth to ensure a good fit. Crowns may be made of gold, high-strength porcelain, resin, porcelain fused to metal or other materials.\n",
      "- Root canals. When decay reaches the inner material of your tooth, called the pulp, you may need a root canal. This is a treatment to repair and save a badly damaged or infected tooth instead of removing it. The diseased tooth pulp is removed. Medicine is sometimes put into the root canal to clear any infection. Then the pulp is replaced with a filling.\n",
      "- Tooth extractions. Some teeth become so seriously decayed that they can't be restored and must be removed. Having a tooth pulled can leave a gap that allows your other teeth to shift. If possible, consider getting a bridge or a dental implant to replace the missing tooth.\n",

      "Your health care provider might then recommend:\n",
      "- Pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, your provider can check your reproductive organs for masses, growths or other changes.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Blood tests can measure hormone levels. This testing can exclude possible causes of menstrual problems or androgen excess that mimic PCOS. You might have other blood testing, such as fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels. A glucose tolerance test can measure your body's response to sugar (glucose).\n",
      "- Ultrasound. An ultrasound can check the appearance of your ovaries and the thickness of the lining of your uterus. A wandlike device (transducer) is placed in your vagina. The transducer emits sound waves that are translated into images on a computer screen.\n",
      "If you have a diagnosis of PCOS, your provider might recommend more tests for complications. These tests can include:\n",
      "- Regular checks of blood pressure, glucose tolerance, and cholesterol and triglyceride levels\n",

      "- Ask detailed questions about your symptoms.\n",
      "- Do a physical exam.\n",
      "- Have you keep a detailed diary of symptoms and possible triggers.\n",
      "If you have a food allergy, your healthcare professional will likely:\n",
      "- Ask you to keep a detailed diary of the foods you eat.\n",
      "- Ask if you've stopped eating the suspected food during the allergy exam.\n",
      "Your healthcare professional also may recommend one or both of the following tests. Be aware that these allergy tests can give results that might not be accurate.\n",
      "- Skin test. A healthcare professional uses a tiny needle to prick or scratch your skin and expose you to small amounts of the proteins found in your potential allergens. If you're allergic, you'll likely develop a raised bump called a hive at the test area on your skin. If the test result suggests you don't have an allergy but your healthcare professional still thinks you might, you may need an exam called an intradermal skin test. Your healthcare professional injects a small amount of allergen into the outer layer of the skin.\n",
      "- Blood test. This test measures the amount of antibodies that the blood makes to destroy allergens. These antibodies are called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. The test is known as specific IgE (sIgE) blood testing. It's also commonly called radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or ImmunoCAP testing. Your blood sample is sent to a lab to find out if you're sensitive to suspected allergens.\n",
      "If your healthcare professional thinks that something other than an allergy is the cause of your symptoms, other tests might be needed to help find the cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Allergy treatments include:\n",
      "- Staying away from allergy triggers, also known as avoidance. Your healthcare professional helps you take steps to spot and stay away from your allergy triggers. Often, this is the most important step in preventing allergic reactions and curbing symptoms.\n",
      "- Medicines. Depending on your allergy, medicines can help turn down your immune system's reaction and ease symptoms. Your healthcare professional might suggest medicine in the form of pills or liquid, nasal sprays, or eye drops.\n",
      "- Immunotherapy. This treatment can help treat severe allergies. It also can help for allergies that don't get better with other treatments. Immunotherapy involves getting a series of shots of purified allergen extracts. These extracts train the immune system not to overreact to your suspected allergen. Most often, the shots are given over a period of a few years.\n",
      "Another form of immunotherapy is a tablet that's placed under the tongue until it dissolves. This is known as sublingual immunotherapy. Sublingual medicines placed under the tongue are used to treat some pollen allergies.\n",
      "- Emergency epinephrine. If you have a severe allergy, you might need to carry an emergency epinephrine shot at all times. An epinephrine shot (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others) can ease symptoms of a severe allergic reaction until you get emergency treatment.\n",

      "Tests may include:\n",
      "- A neurological exam. This is to look at your behavior, motor abilities and how your brain works.\n",
      "- Blood tests. A blood sample can show blood sugar levels and look for signs of infections or gene conditions. A health professional also may check the levels of salts in the body that manage the balance of fluids. These salts are called electrolytes.\n",
      "- A spinal tap. This procedure collects a sample of fluid from the spine for testing. Also called a lumbar puncture, a spinal tap may show whether an infection caused a seizure.\n",
      "- An electroencephalogram (EEG). In this test, electrodes are put on the scalp to record the electrical activity of the brain. The electrical activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may show a pattern that tells whether a seizure is likely to happen again.\n",
      "EEG testing also may help rule out other conditions that have symptoms like those of epilepsy. This test may be done at a clinic, overnight at home or over a few nights in the hospital.\n",
      "Imaging tests may include:\n",
      "- MRI. An MRI scan uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of the brain. An MRI may show changes in the brain that could lead to seizures.\n",
      "- CT scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to get cross-sectional images of the brain. CT scans can show changes in the brain that might cause a seizure. Those changes may include tumors, bleeding and cysts.\n",
      "- Positron emission tomography (PET). A PET scan uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's put into a vein. The material helps show active areas of the brain and brain changes.\n",
      "- Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's put into a vein. The test creates a detailed 3D map of the blood flow in the brain that happens during a seizure.\n",
      "A healthcare professional also may do a type of SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered with MRI (SISCOM). The test may give results with even more detail. This test is usually done in a hospital with overnight EEG recording.\n",

      "Diagnosis involves the steps that a healthcare professional takes to find out if your child has obesity. A healthcare professional calculates your child's BMI and figures out where it falls on a standard growth chart.\n",
      "Your child's healthcare professional uses the growth chart to find out how your child's weight compares with that of other children of the same sex and age. This is called your child's BMI percentile. For example, a child in the 80th percentile has a higher BMI than 80% of other children of the same sex and age.\n",
      "Cutoff points on these growth charts mean the following:\n",
      "- Underweight — BMI 5th percentile or below.\n",
      "- Healthy weight — BMI between 5th and 84th percentiles.\n",
      "- Overweight — BMI between 85th and 94th percentiles.\n",
      "- Obese — BMI 95th percentile or above.\n",
      "- Severely obese — BMI greater than or equal to 120% of the 95th percentile.\n",
      "BMI doesn't take into account factors such as being muscular or having a larger than average body frame. What's more, growth patterns vary greatly among children. So, the healthcare professional also factors in your child's growth and development to help find out whether your child's weight is a health concern.\n",
      "Along with BMI and charting weight on the growth charts, the healthcare professional looks at:\n",
      "- Your family's history of obesity and weight-related health conditions, such as diabetes.\n",
      "- Your child's eating habits. This can include what your child eats and how often, and how big the portion sizes are.\n",
      "- Your child's activity level and amount of screen time.\n",
      "- Your child's blood pressure.\n",
      "- Other health conditions your child has or medicines your child takes.\n",
      "- Mental health history, including bouts of depression, sleep troubles, and whether your child feels isolated, alone or bullied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for childhood obesity is based on factors such as your child's age and whether your child has other health conditions. Treatment usually includes changes in your child's eating habits and physical activity level. The key is to make these healthy changes over time and help your child follow them long term. Sometimes, treatment also includes medicines or weight-loss surgery.\n",
      "Experts recommend that treatment include a mix of the following:\n",
      "- A healthcare team's guidance on nutrition and physical activity.\n",
      "- Skills for building habits as a family to form a healthy lifestyle over time. These habits need to work for the family long term.\n",
      "In some areas, these treatments are offered in the form of classes that children and parents attend together. Or parents might go to such classes and apply what they've learned at home. When these classes aren't available, your child's healthcare professional may need to work with you to arrange key parts of the treatment plan. These parts include visits with a dietitian and more-regular healthcare visits that are focused on supporting healthy habits and goals.\n",
      "Your child's healthcare professional likely will set healthy eating and physical activity goals for your family and your child. Any goal for your child's weight is tailored to:\n",
      "- Your child's age.\n",
      "- The severity of the obesity.\n",
      "- Whether your child has obesity-related health conditions.\n",
      "Remember, success with treatment partly depends on how committed you are to helping your child make long-term healthy changes. Understand that your child is still growing. And be aware that healthy-lifestyle changes can benefit your child and family in ways that the scale may not or cannot show.\n",

      "- Tests for H. pylori. Your healthcare professional may recommend tests such as a stool test or breath test to determine whether you have H. pylori. Which type of test you have depends on your situation.\n",
      "For the breath test, you drink a small glass of clear, tasteless liquid that contains radioactive carbon. H. pylori germs break down the test liquid in your stomach. Later, you blow into a bag, which is then sealed. If you're infected with H. pylori, your breath sample will contain the radioactive carbon.\n",
      "- Passing a thin, flexible scope down the throat, called an endoscopy. Endoscopy is a procedure to examine the digestive system with a long, thin tube with a tiny camera, called an endoscope. The endoscope passes down the throat, into the esophagus, stomach and small intestine. Using the endoscope, your healthcare professional looks for signs of inflammation. Depending on your age and medical history, your healthcare professional may recommend this as a first test instead of testing for H. pylori.\n",
      "If a suspicious area is found, your healthcare professional may remove small tissue samples, called a biopsy, to test in a lab. A biopsy also can identify the presence of H. pylori in your stomach lining.\n",
      "- X-ray of your upper digestive system. X-rays can create images of your esophagus, stomach and small intestine to look for anything unusual. You may have to swallow a white, metallic liquid that contains barium. The liquid coats your digestive tract and makes an ulcer more visible. This procedure is called a barium swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment of gastritis depends on the specific cause. Acute gastritis caused by NSAIDs or alcohol may be relieved by stopping use of those substances.\n",
      "Medicines used to treat gastritis include:\n",
      "- Antibiotics to kill H. pylori. For H. pylori in your digestive tract, your healthcare professional may recommend a combination of antibiotics to kill the germs. Be sure to take the full antibiotic prescription, usually for 7 to 14 days. You also may take a medicine to block acid production. Once treated, your healthcare professional will retest you for H. pylori to be sure it has been destroyed.\n",
      "- Medicines that block acid production and promote healing. Medicines called proton pump inhibitors help reduce acid. They do this by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. You may get a prescription for proton pump inhibitors, or you can buy them without a prescription.\n",
      "Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, particularly at high doses, may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures. Ask your healthcare professional whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk.\n",
      "- Medicines to reduce acid production. Acid blockers, also called histamine blockers, reduce the amount of acid released into your digestive tract. Reducing acid relieves gastritis pain and encourages healing. You may get a prescription for an acid blocker, or you can buy one without a prescription.\n",
      "- Medicines that neutralize stomach acid. Your healthcare professional may include an antacid in your treatment. Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief. These help with immediate symptom relief but are generally not used as a primary treatment. Side effects of antacids can include constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredients. Proton pump inhibitors and acid blockers are more effective and have fewer side effects.\n",

      "Diagnostic tests may include:\n",
      "- Measurements. A regular part of a well-baby medical exam is the measurement of height, weight and head size. At each visit, your pediatrician plots these measurements on a chart to show your child's current percentile ranking for each one. This is important for identifying growth that isn't typical, such as delayed growth or a large head in relation to the rest of the body. If any trends in these charts are a concern, your child's pediatrician may take measurements more often.\n",
      "- Appearance. Many distinct facial and skeletal features are related to each of several dwarfism conditions. How your child looks also may help your pediatrician and geneticist make a diagnosis.\n",
      "- Imaging technology. Your healthcare professional may order imaging studies, such as X-rays, because certain differences in the skull and skeleton can indicate which condition your child may have. Various imaging devices also may reveal delayed maturation of bones, as is the case when growth hormone levels are low. An MRI scan may show if the pituitary gland or hypothalamus is not typical.\n",
      "- Genetic tests. Genetic tests are available for many genetic causes of dwarfism-related conditions. Your doctor may suggest a test to confirm the diagnosis. This test could help manage the condition and aid in family planning. For example, if your doctor thinks your daughter may have Turner syndrome, a special lab test may be done that looks at the X chromosomes in blood cells.\n",
      "- Family history. Your pediatrician may ask about the height of your siblings, parents, grandparents or other blood relatives to find out whether the average range of height in your family includes short stature.\n",

      "- Mohs surgery. This procedure is for larger, recurring or difficult-to-treat skin cancers, which may include both basal and squamous cell carcinomas. It's often used in areas where it's necessary to conserve as much skin as possible, such as on the nose.\n",
      "During Mohs surgery, your doctor removes the skin growth layer by layer, examining each layer under the microscope, until no abnormal cells remain. This procedure allows cancerous cells to be removed without taking an excessive amount of surrounding healthy skin.\n",
      "- Curettage and electrodesiccation or cryotherapy. After removing most of a growth, your doctor scrapes away layers of cancer cells using a device with a circular blade (curet). An electric needle destroys any remaining cancer cells. In a variation of this procedure, liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze the base and edges of the treated area.\n",
      "These simple, quick procedures may be used to treat basal cell cancers or thin squamous cell cancers.\n",

      "- Chemotherapy. In chemotherapy, drugs are used to kill cancer cells. For cancers limited to the top layer of skin, creams or lotions containing anti-cancer agents may be applied directly to the skin. Systemic chemotherapy can be used to treat skin cancers that have spread to other parts of the body.\n",

      "- Parenting skills training. A mental health professional with experience treating ODD can help you develop parenting skills that are more consistent, positive and less frustrating for you and your child.

Involving other authority figures, such as teachers, in the training may be an important part of treatment.\n",

Using an \"ear bug\" audio device, the therapist guides you through strategies that reinforce your child's positive behavior. As a result, you can learn more-effective parenting techniques, improve the quality of your relationship with your child and reduce problem behaviors.\n",
      "- Individual and family therapy. Individual therapy for your child may help them learn to manage anger and express feelings in a healthier way. Family therapy may help improve your communication and relationships and help your family members learn how to work together.\n",
      "- Problem-solving training. Cognitive problem-solving therapy can help your child identify and change thought patterns that lead to behavior problems. In a type of therapy called collaborative problem-solving, you and your child work together to come up with solutions that work for both of you.\n",
      "- Social skills training. Your child also may benefit from therapy that will help them be more flexible and learn how to interact in a more positive and effective way with peers.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Your doctor will typically diagnose you with tinnitus based on your symptoms alone. But in order to treat your symptoms, your doctor will also try to identify whether your tinnitus is caused by another, underlying condition. Sometimes a cause can't be found.\n",
      "To help identify the cause of your tinnitus, your doctor will likely ask you about your medical history and examine your ears, head and neck. Common tests include:\n",
      "- Hearing (audiological) exam. During the test, you'll sit in a soundproof room wearing earphones that transmit specific sounds into one ear at a time. You'll indicate when you can hear the sound, and your results will be compared with results considered normal for your age. This can help rule out or identify possible causes of tinnitus.\n",
      "- Movement. Your doctor may ask you to move your eyes, clench your jaw, or move your neck, arms and legs. If your tinnitus changes or worsens, it may help identify an underlying disorder that needs treatment.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. Depending on the suspected cause of your tinnitus, you may need imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans.\n",
      "- Lab tests. Your doctor may draw blood to check for anemia, thyroid problems, heart disease or vitamin deficiencies.\n",
      "Do your best to describe for your doctor what kind of tinnitus noises you hear. The sounds you hear can help your doctor identify a possible underlying cause.\n",
      "- Clicking. This type of sound suggests that muscle contractions in and around your ear might be the cause of your tinnitus.\n",
      "- Pulsing, rushing or humming. These sounds usually stem from blood vessel (vascular) causes, such as high blood pressure, and you may notice them when you exercise or change positions, such as when you lie down or stand up.\n",
      "- Low-pitched ringing. This type of sound may point to ear canal blockages, Meniere's disease or stiff inner ear bones (otosclerosis).\n",
      "- High-pitched ringing. This is the most commonly heard tinnitus sound. Likely causes include loud noise exposure, hearing loss or medications. Acoustic neuroma can cause continuous, high-pitched ringing in one ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for tinnitus depends on whether your tinnitus is caused by an underlying health condition. If so, your doctor may be able to reduce your symptoms by treating the underlying cause. Examples include:\n",
      "- Earwax removal. Removing an earwax blockage can decrease tinnitus symptoms.\n",
      "- Treating a blood vessel condition. Underlying blood vessel conditions may require medication, surgery or another treatment to address the problem.\n",
      "- Hearing aids. If your tinnitus is caused by noise-induced or age-related hearing loss, using hearing aids may help improve your symptoms.\n",
      "- Changing your medication. If a medication you're taking appears to be the cause of tinnitus, your doctor may recommend stopping or reducing the drug, or switching to a different medication.\n",

      "To diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome, your healthcare professional may ask you questions about your symptoms. You also may need one or more tests to find out whether you have carpal tunnel syndrome:\n",
      "- History of symptoms. The pattern of your symptoms is important in making a diagnosis. Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms usually occur while holding a phone or a newspaper or gripping a steering wheel. They also tend to occur at night and may wake you from sleep. Or you may notice the numbness when you wake up in the morning.\n",
      "But the median nerve doesn't provide sensation to the little finger. If you have symptoms in that finger, you may have a condition other than carpal tunnel syndrome.\n",
      "- Physical exam. Your healthcare professional tests the feeling in the fingers and the strength of the muscles in the hand.\n",
      "Bending the wrist, tapping on the nerve or simply pressing on the nerve can trigger symptoms in many people.\n",
      "- X-ray. You may need an X-ray of the affected wrist to exclude other causes of wrist pain, such as arthritis or fracture. However, X-rays are not helpful in making a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.\n",
      "- Ultrasound. An ultrasound of the wrist provides a picture of the tendons and nerves. This can help show whether the nerve is being compressed.\n",
      "- Electromyography. This test measures the tiny electrical discharges produced in muscles. During this test, a thin-needle electrode is inserted into specific muscles to evaluate the electrical activity when muscles contract and rest. This test can identify damage to the muscles controlled by the median nerve. The test also may rule out other conditions.\n",
      "- Nerve conduction study. In a variation of electromyography, two electrodes are taped to the skin. A small shock is passed through the median nerve to see if electrical impulses are slowed in the carpal tunnel. This test may be used to diagnose the condition and rule out other conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treat carpal tunnel syndrome as early as possible after symptoms start. In the early stages, simple things that you can do for yourself may make the symptoms go away. For example:\n",
      "- Take more-frequent breaks to rest the hands.\n",
      "- Don't do activities that make symptoms worse.\n",
      "- Use cold packs to reduce swelling.\n",
      "Other treatment options include wrist splinting, medicines and surgery. Splinting and other conservative treatments are more likely to help if you've had only mild to moderate symptoms that come and go for less than 10 months.\n",
      "If you have numbness in your hands, get treatment from a healthcare professional.\n",

      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "The itching and flaking of dandruff can almost always be controlled. For mild dandruff, first try regular cleansing with a gentle shampoo to reduce oil and skin cell buildup. If that doesn't help, try a medicated dandruff shampoo. Some people can tolerate using a medicated shampoo two to three times a week, with regular shampooing on other days if needed. People with drier hair would benefit from less frequent shampooing and a moisturizing conditioner for the hair or scalp.\n",
      "Hair and scalp products, both medicated and nonmedicated, are available as solutions, foams, gels, sprays, ointments and oils. You may need to try more than one product to find the routine that works for you. And you'll likely need repeated or long-term treatment.\n",
      "If you develop itching or stinging from any product, stop using it. If you develop an allergic reaction — such as a rash, hives or difficulty breathing — seek immediate medical attention.\n",
      "Dandruff shampoos are classified according to the medication they contain. Some are available in stronger formulations by prescription.\n",
      "- Pyrithione zinc shampoos (DermaZinc, Head & Shoulders, others). These contain the antibacterial and antifungal agent zinc pyrithione.\n",
      "- Tar-based shampoos (Neutrogena T/Gel, Scalp 18 Coal Tar Shampoo, others). Coal tar slows how quickly skin cells on your scalp die and flake off. If you have light-colored hair, this type of shampoo may cause discoloration. It can also make the scalp more sensitive to sunlight.\n",
      "- Shampoos containing salicylic acid (Jason Dandruff Relief Treatment Shampoo, Baker P&S, others). These products help eliminate scaling.\n",
      "- Selenium sulfide shampoos (Head & Shoulders Intensive, Selsun Blue, others). These contain an antifungal agent. Use these products as directed and rinse well after shampooing, as they can discolor the hair and scalp.\n",
      "- Ketoconazole shampoos (Nizoral Anti-Dandruff). This shampoo is intended to kill dandruff-causing fungi that live on your scalp.\n",
      "- Fluocinolone shampoos (Capex, Derma-Smoothe/FS, others). These products contain a corticosteroid to help control itching, flaking and irritation.\n",
      "If one type of shampoo works for a time and then seems to lose its effectiveness, try alternating between two types of dandruff shampoos. Once your dandruff is under control, try using the medicated shampoo less frequently for maintenance and prevention.\n",
      "Read and follow the directions on each bottle of shampoo you try. Some products need to be left on for a few minutes, while others need to be rinsed off quickly.\n",
      "If you've used medicated shampoo regularly for several weeks and still have dandruff, talk to your doctor or dermatologist. You may need a prescription-strength shampoo or a steroid lotion.\n",

      "You also can measure your blood pressure at home. Checking your blood pressure at home can help your healthcare professional diagnose high blood pressure earlier than usual. Ask a member of your healthcare team to:\n",
      "- Help you pick a blood pressure monitor.\n",
      "- Tell you how often to check your blood pressure.\n",
      "- Explain what blood pressure numbers should prompt you to call the medical office right away.\n",

      "Treatment:\n",
      "Low blood pressure without symptoms or with only mild symptoms rarely requires treatment.\n",

For instance, if medicine causes low blood pressure, your healthcare professional may recommend changing or stopping the medicine. Or the dose of medicine might be lowered. Don't change or stop taking your medicine without first talking to your healthcare professional.\n",
      "If the cause of low blood pressure isn't clear or if no treatment exists, the goal is to raise blood pressure and relieve symptoms. Depending on your age, health and the type of low blood pressure you have, there are various ways to do this:\n",
      "- Use more salt. Experts usually recommend limiting table salt and foods high in sodium. That's because salt and sodium can raise blood pressure, sometimes by a lot. For people with low blood pressure, though, that can be a good thing. But too much salt or sodium can lead to heart failure, especially in older adults. So it's important to check with a healthcare professional before eating more salt or high-sodium foods.\n",
      "- Drink more water. Fluids increase blood volume and help prevent dehydration, both of which are important in treating hypotension.\n",
      "- Wear compression stockings. Also called support stockings, these elastic stockings are often used to relieve the pain and swelling of varicose veins. They improve blood flow from the legs to the heart. Some people have an easier time using compression belts around the stomach area than they do using compression stockings. The compression belts are called abdominal binders.\n",
      "- Medicines. Various medicines can treat low blood pressure that occurs when standing up, also called orthostatic hypotension. For example, the drug fludrocortisone boosts blood volume. It's often used to treat orthostatic hypotension.\n",
      "If you have long-term orthostatic hypotension, midodrine (Orvaten) may be prescribed to raise standing blood pressure levels. This medicine lessens the ability of the blood vessels to expand, which raises blood pressure.\n",

      "- Rectal temperature to check core body temperature. A rectal temperature is the most accurate way of determining core body temperature and is more accurate than mouth or forehead temperatures.\n",
      "- A blood test to check blood sodium and potassium and the content of gases in blood to see if there's been damage to the central nervous system.\n",
      "- A urine test to check the color of urine because it's usually darker if someone has a heat-related condition. A urine test also checks kidney function, which can be affected by heatstroke.\n",
      "- Muscle damage tests to check for serious damage to the muscle tissue, known as rhabdomyolysis.\n",
      "- X-rays and other imaging tests to check for damage to the internal organs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Heatstroke treatment centers on cooling the body to a standard temperature to prevent or reduce damage to the brain and vital organs. To do this, a healthcare professional may take these steps:\n",
      "- Immersion in cold water. A bath of cold or ice water has been proved to be the most effective way of quickly lowering the core body temperature. The quicker someone with heatstroke receives cold water immersion, the less risk of death and organ damage.\n",
      "- Use evaporation cooling techniques. If cold water immersion is not available, healthcare professionals may try to lower body temperature using an evaporation method. Cool water is misted on the body while warm air is fanned over the person, causing the water to evaporate and cool the skin.\n",
      "- Packing with ice and cooling blankets. Another method is to wrap a person in a special cooling blanket and apply ice packs to the groin, neck, back and armpits to lower temperature.\n",
      "- Give medicines to stop shivering. If treatments to lower body temperature make you shiver, your doctor may give you a muscle relaxant, such as a benzodiazepine. Shivering increases your body temperature, making treatment less effective.\n",

      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Although there is no cure for tuberous sclerosis, treatment can help manage specific symptoms. For example:\n",
      "- Medicine. Anti-seizure medicines may be prescribed to control seizures. Other medicines may help manage heart rhythm problems, behavior problems or other symptoms. A medicine called everolimus (Afinitor, Zortress) may be used to treat certain types of brain and kidney growths that can't be removed with surgery. Using these medicines early in care may help reduce the risk of seizures. The topical ointment form of a medicine called sirolimus (Hyftor) may help treat acnelike skin growths.\n",
      "- Surgery. If a growth affects the function of a specific organ — such as the kidney, brain or heart — the growth may be removed with surgery. Sometimes surgery helps control seizures caused by brain growths that don't respond to medicine. Surgical procedures such as dermabrasion or laser treatment may improve the appearance of skin growths.\n",
      "- Therapy. Early intervention services, such as occupational, physical or speech therapy, may be helpful. These therapies can help children with tuberous sclerosis who have special needs in these areas. The therapies can improve children's ability to manage daily tasks and activities.\n",
      "- Educational and vocational services. Early intervention and special needs services can help children with developmental delays and behavior issues adapt to the classroom. This can help them meet their full potential. When needed, social, vocational and rehabilitation services may continue throughout life.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "For polycystic kidney disease, certain tests can detect the size and number of kidney cysts you have. Tests also can show how much healthy kidney tissue you have. Tests include:\n",
      "- MRI scan. As you lie inside a large cylinder, magnetic fields and radio waves show views of your kidneys. This method most often is used to know how badly PKD affects the kidneys, liver or pancreas. MRI can help measure total kidney volume, which helps healthcare professionals know more about your condition.\n",
      "- Ultrasound. This involves putting a wandlike device called a transducer on your body. It gives off sound waves that go back to the transducer. A computer turns the sound waves into images of your kidneys.\n",
      "- CT scan. You lie on a table that goes into a big, doughnut-shaped device. The device uses X-ray beams to show images of your kidneys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "How bad polycystic kidney disease is varies from person to person. That's true even among people in the same family. Often, people with PKD reach end-stage kidney disease between ages 55 and 65. But some people with PKD have mild disease. They might never get to end-stage kidney disease.\n",
      "Treating polycystic kidney disease involves dealing with the following symptoms and complications in their early stages:\n",
      "- Kidney cyst growth. The medicine tolvaptan (Jynarque, Samsca) may be used for adults at risk of ADPKD that's getting worse fast. Tolvaptan is a pill that you swallow that slows how fast kidney cysts grow. It also slows the decline in how well your kidneys work.\n",
      "Tolvaptan carries a risk of serious liver injury. And it can interact with other medicines you take. It's best to see a specialist in kidney health, called a nephrologist. A nephrologist can watch for side effects and possible complications of the medicine.\n",
      "- High blood pressure. Keeping high blood pressure under control can slow the disease and kidney damage. Eating a low-sodium, low-fat diet that's moderate in protein and calories and drinking more fluids may help control blood pressure.\n",
      "Other helpful lifestyle changes include not smoking, moving more and easing stress. Smoking can greatly harm the kidneys. It also can speed up the start of kidney failure.\n",
      "Medicines most often are needed to control high blood pressure. Medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are often used to control high blood pressure.\n",
      "- Loss of kidney function. To help your kidneys stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible, experts suggest being at a healthy weight and body mass index. Drinking water and fluids throughout the day may help slow the growth of kidney cysts. This could slow the loss of kidney function. Eating a low-salt diet with less protein might let kidney cysts respond better to more fluids.\n",
      "- Pain. You might be able to control the pain of polycystic kidney disease with medicines available without a prescription, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Don't take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines can affect how your kidneys work.\n",
      "For worse pain, a healthcare professional might use a needle to draw out cyst fluid and put in a medicine to shrink kidney cysts. The medicine is called a sclerosing agent.\n",
      "Or you may need surgery to remove cysts if they're large enough to cause pressure and pain. The surgery is called cyst fenestration.\n",
      "- Bladder or kidney infections. Treating infections quickly with antibiotics can help prevent kidney damage. You might have a simple bladder infection or a more complicated cyst or kidney infection. For more-complicated infections, you may need to take antibiotics longer.\n",
      "- Blood in the urine. Drink lots of fluids as soon as you notice blood in your urine. It's best to drink water to dilute the urine. This might help prevent clots from forming in your urinary tract.\n",
      "Most often, the bleeding stops on its own. If it doesn't, call your healthcare professional.\n",
      "- Kidney failure. Your kidneys can stop removing waste and extra fluids from your blood. Then you need either dialysis or a kidney transplant. That's why you need to see your healthcare team regularly.\n",
      "You may be able to have a kidney transplant before your kidneys fail. Then you wouldn't need to have dialysis. This is called preemptive kidney transplantation.\n",
      "- Aneurysms. If you have polycystic kidney disease and a family history of brain aneurysms that burst, your healthcare team may want to do regular screenings for brain aneurysms.\n",
      "If you have an aneurysm, surgical clipping might reduce the risk of bleeding. This depends on the size of the aneurysm. Nonsurgical treatment of small aneurysms may involve controlling high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, as well as quitting smoking.\n",
      "Early treatment offers the best chance of slowing the progress of polycystic kidney disease.\n",

      "If you have Buerger disease and smoke or use tobacco in any form, talk to your health care provider about ways to quit. Nicotine replacement products aren't an option because they still have nicotine in them. Nicotine is thought to irritate the blood vessels. Your health care provider can recommend other medicines that might help.\n",
      "Another option is a live-in program to help you stop smoking. You typically stay at a treatment center or hospital for a few days or weeks. You'll learn how to stop cravings for cigarettes and how to live tobacco-free.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "A doctor typically diagnoses Noonan syndrome after seeing some key signs. But this can be difficult because some features of the condition are not easily seen and are hard to find. Sometimes Noonan syndrome is not found until adulthood, after a person has a child who is more clearly affected by the condition. Genetic testing can confirm a diagnosis.\n",
      "If there's evidence of heart problems, a cardiologist can find out the type and how serious it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Although there's no cure for Noonan syndrome, treatments can help decrease its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment begins, the greater the benefits.\n",
      "Treatment for Noonan syndrome depends on the symptoms and complications and how serious they are. Many of the health and physical issues are treated the same as they would be for anyone else. Given the many problems with this condition, a coordinated team approach is best.\n",
      "Recommended approaches may include:\n",
      "- Heart treatment. Certain drugs may treat some kinds of heart problems. If there's a problem with the heart's valves, surgery may be needed. The doctor also may recommend that heart function be looked at from time to time.\n",
      "- Treating low growth rate. A health care professional should measure height three times a year until age 3 and then once a year until adulthood. This will make sure your child is growing. To find out if there is a problem with nutrition, blood tests may be ordered. If your child's growth hormone levels are not high enough, growth hormone therapy may be a treatment option.\n",
      "- Managing learning disabilities. For early childhood developmental delays, ask your doctor or health care professional about infant stimulation programs. Physical and speech therapies may be needed. In some cases, special education or teaching strategies tailored to your child's needs may be appropriate.\n",
      "- Vision and hearing treatments. Eye exams are recommended at least every two years. Glasses alone can treat most eye issues. Surgery may be needed for some conditions, such as cataracts. Hearing screenings are recommended yearly during childhood.\n",
      "- Treatment for bleeding and bruising. If there's a history of easy bruising or bleeding problems, do not use aspirin and aspirin-containing products. In some cases, doctors may prescribe drugs that help blood clot. Let health care professionals know about issues with bleeding and bruising before any procedures.\n",
      "- Treatment for fluid buildup. Buildup of fluid in the body may or may not need treatment. Talk with your doctor or health care team about this. They may suggest certain steps to take.\n",
      "- Treatment for genital problems. If one or both testicles have not moved into the proper position within the first few months of life, your child may need surgery.\n",
      "Other evaluations and regular follow-up care may be needed. This depends on specific issues. Anyone with Noonan syndrome should have medical follow-up from time to time on an ongoing basis.\n",

      "- Be more active. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up sugar for energy and helps the body use insulin more effectively. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous exercise.\n",
      "- Lose excess weight. If you're overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight — about 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms) — can significantly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits.\n",
      "- Stop smoking. Stopping smoking can improve the way insulin works, improving your blood sugar level.\n",

      "- A scope with ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound, also called EUS, is a test to make pictures of the digestive tract and nearby organs and tissues. EUS uses a long, thin tube with a camera, called an endoscope. The endoscope passes down the throat and into the stomach. An ultrasound device on the endoscope uses sound waves to create images of nearby tissues. It can be used to make pictures of the pancreas.\n",
      "- Removing a tissue sample for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for testing in a lab. Most often, a health professional gets the sample during EUS. During EUS, special tools are passed through the endoscope to take some tissue from the pancreas. Less often, a sample of tissue is collected from the pancreas by inserting a needle through the skin and into the pancreas. This is called fine-needle aspiration.\n",
      "The sample goes to the lab for testing to see if its cancer. Other specialized tests can show what DNA changes are present in the cancer cells. The results help your health care team create your treatment plan.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Blood tests might show proteins called tumor markers that pancreatic cancer cells make. One tumor marker test used in pancreatic cancer is called CA19-9. Doctors often repeat this test during and after treatment to understand how the cancer is responding. Some pancreatic cancers don't make extra CA19-9, so this test isn't helpful for everyone.\n",
      "- Genetic testing. If you're diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, talk with your health care team about genetic testing. Genetic testing uses a sample of blood or saliva to look for inherited DNA changes that increase the risk of cancer. Results of genetic testing might help guide your treatment. The results also can show whether family members might have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.\n",

This exam may include checking your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes. If you have trouble in one or more areas, this is a clue for your health care provider. A neurological exam doesn't detect a brain tumor. But it helps your provider understand what part of your brain might be having a problem.\n",

So CT might be the first imaging test that's done if you have headaches or other symptoms that have many possible causes. A CT scan can detect problems in and around your brain. The results give your health care provider clues to decide what test to do next. If your provider thinks your CT scan shows a brain tumor, you might need a brain MRI.\n",
      "- Brain MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging, also called MRI, uses strong magnets to create pictures of the inside of the body. MRI is often used to detect brain tumors because it shows the brain more clearly than do other imaging tests.\n",
      "Often a dye is injected into a vein in the arm before an MRI. The dye makes clearer pictures. This makes it easier to see smaller tumors. It can help your health care team see the difference between a brain tumor and healthy brain tissue.\n",
      "Sometimes you need a special type of MRI to create more-detailed pictures. One example is functional MRI. This special MRI shows which parts of the brain control speaking, moving and other important tasks. This helps your health care provider plan surgery and other treatments.\n",
      "Another special MRI test is magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This test uses MRI to measure levels of certain chemicals in the tumor cells. Having too much or too little of the chemicals might tell your health care team about the kind of brain tumor you have.\n",
      "Magnetic resonance perfusion is another special type of MRI. This test uses MRI to measure the amount of blood in different parts of the brain tumor. The parts of the tumor that have a higher amount of blood may be the most active parts of the tumor. Your health care team uses this information to plan your treatment.\n",
      "- PET scan of the brain. A positron emission tomography scan, also called a PET scan, can detect some brain tumors. A PET scan uses a radioactive tracer that's injected into a vein. The tracer travels through the blood and attaches to brain tumor cells. The tracer makes the tumor cells stand out on the pictures taken by the PET machine. Cells that are dividing and multiplying quickly will take up more of the tracer.\n",
      "A PET scan may be most helpful for detecting brain tumors that are growing quickly. Examples include glioblastomas and some oligodendrogliomas. Brain tumors that grow slowly might not be detected on a PET scan. Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to grow more slowly, so PET scans are less useful for benign brain tumors. Not everyone with a brain tumor needs a PET scan. Ask your health care provider whether you need at PET scan.\n",
      "- Collecting a sample of tissue. A brain biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of brain tumor tissue for testing in a lab. Often a surgeon gets the sample during surgery to remove the brain tumor.\n",
      "    \n",
      "If surgery isn't possible, a sample might be removed with a needle. Removing a sample of brain tumor tissue with a needle is done with a procedure called stereotactic needle biopsy.\n",
      "During this procedure, a small hole is drilled in the skull. A thin needle is inserted through the hole. The needle is used to take a tissue sample. Imaging tests such as CT and MRI are used to plan the path of the needle. You won't feel anything during the biopsy because medicine is used to numb the area. Often you also receive medicine that puts you in a sleep-like state so you're not aware.\n",
      "You might have a needle biopsy rather than surgery if your health care team is worried that an operation might hurt an important part of your brain. A needle might be needed to remove tissue from a brain tumor if the tumor is in a spot that's hard to reach with surgery.\n",
      "Brain biopsy has a risk of complications. Risks include bleeding in the brain and damage to the brain tissue.\n",
      "- Testing the tissue sample in the lab. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing. Tests can see whether the cells are cancerous or not cancerous. The way the cells look under a microscope can tell your health care team how quickly the cells are growing. This is called the brain tumor's grade. Other tests can find out what DNA changes are present in the cells. This helps your health care team create your treatment plan.\n",

Small, benign brain tumors might not grow or might grow so slowly that they won't ever cause problems. You might have brain MRI scans a few times a year to check for brain tumor growth. If the brain tumor grows more quickly than expected or if you develop symptoms, you might need treatment.\n",

      "Certain therapies may ease or delay some of the symptoms of progeria. Treatments depend on your child's condition and symptoms. These may include:\n",
      "- Lonafarnib (Zokinvy). This oral medicine helps prevent the buildup of faulty progerin and progerin-like proteins in cells. Preventing this buildup in cells can slow the progression of symptoms that occur in progeria, which can help some children live longer. The medicine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for children 1 year and older.\n",
      "- Low-dose aspirin. A daily dose may help prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n",
      "- Other medicines. Depending on your child's condition, the health care provider may prescribe other medicines to treat complications. These may include dietary therapy, possibly with statins to help blood vessels and heart function. Also, blood thinners to help prevent blood clots. Medicines to treat headaches and other symptoms may be needed.\n",
      "- Physical and occupational therapy. Physical therapy can help with joint stiffness and hip problems to help your child remain active. Occupational therapy can help your child learn ways to manage daily activities, such as dressing, brushing teeth and eating.\n",
      "- Nutrition. A balanced diet that includes healthy, high-calorie foods can help maintain adequate nutrition. Sometimes nutrition supplements are needed to provide extra calories.\n",
      "- Hearing aids. Although low-frequency hearing loss does not usually affect daily activities, sometimes listening devices or hearing aids are needed.\n",
      "- Eye and vision care. Not being able to close eyelids completely can cause dry eyes and damage to the surface of the eye. Moisturizing eye products and regular vision care can help.\n",

      "A standard echocardiogram is done from outside the body. But sometimes, a more-detailed echocardiogram is needed to get a closer look at the mitral valve. This type of echocardiogram is called a transesophageal echocardiogram. It is done from inside the body.\n",
      "- Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick and simple test measures the heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast or how slowly the heart is beating. Sticky patches called sensors or electrodes are attached to the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the patches to a computer, which prints or displays results.\n",
      "- Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray is a picture of the heart and lungs. It can show whether the heart is enlarged, which can be a sign of certain types of heart valve disease.\n",
      "- Cardiac MRI. This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the heart. A cardiac MRI might be done to determine the severity of mitral valve disease.\n",
      "- Exercise tests or stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart is checked. Exercise tests help reveal how the heart responds to physical activity and whether valve disease symptoms occur during exercise. If you can't exercise, you may get medicine that affects the heart like exercise does.\n",
      "- Cardiac catheterization. A doctor guides a thin tube called a catheter through a blood vessel to an artery in the heart. Dye flows through the catheter. This makes the heart arteries show up more clearly on an X-ray.\n",

      "- Compression. To help stop swelling, compress the area with an elastic bandage until the swelling stops. Don't wrap it too tightly or you may hinder circulation. Begin wrapping at the end farthest from your heart. Loosen the wrap if the pain increases, the area becomes numb or swelling is occurring below the wrapped area.\n",
      "- Elevation. Elevate the injured area above the level of your heart, especially at night, which allows gravity to help reduce swelling.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "The symptoms of hypothyroidism can be different from person to person. And they often look like symptoms of other health problems. Because of that, a diagnosis of hypothyroidism doesn't rely on symptoms alone. It's usually based on the results of blood tests.\n",
      "The first blood test typically done to diagnose hypothyroidism measures the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood. If it's high, the test is done again, along with a blood test for the thyroid hormone T-4. If the results show that TSH is high and T-4 is low, then the diagnosis is hypothyroidism. In some cases, the thyroid hormone T-3 may be measured as well.\n",
      "If the second test shows high TSH but T-4 and T-3 are in the standard range, then the diagnosis is a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism. It usually doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms.\n",
      "TSH tests also play an important role in managing hypothyroidism over time. They help your health care provider find and maintain the right dosage of medication for you.\n",
      "The results of these blood tests can be affected by some medicines or supplements. This includes biotin, a vitamin taken as a stand-alone supplement or as part of a multivitamin. Before you have blood tests done, tell your health care provider about any medicines or supplements you take.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for hypothyroidism usually includes taking the thyroid hormone medicine levothyroxine (Levo-T, Synthroid, others) every day. This medicine is taken by mouth. It returns hormone levels to a healthy range, eliminating symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "You'll likely start to feel better one or two weeks after you begin treatment. Treatment with levothyroxine likely will be lifelong. Because the dosage you need may change, your health care provider may check your TSH level every year.\n",

      "- Nocturnal sleep study (polysomnography). If your sleep is severely disturbed, your doctor may recommend an overnight sleep study to help determine if the nightmares are connected to another sleep disorder.

      "- Hormone testing. Blood tests can show hormone level changes that are a sign of Klinefelter syndrome.\n",
      "- Chromosome analysis. Also called a karyotype, this test can confirm a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome. A blood sample is sent to the lab to check the shape and number of chromosomes.\n",
      "Healthcare professionals sometimes diagnose Klinefelter syndrome before birth when testing is done for another reason. The syndrome can be found in pregnancy during a procedure to look at fetal cells taken from the fluid around the baby or from the placenta. These tests may be done for pregnant people who are older than age 35 or have a family history of genetic conditions.\n",
      "Klinefelter syndrome may be suspected during a noninvasive prenatal screening blood test. This test looks at cell-free DNA in the pregnant person's blood sample. To confirm the diagnosis, more-invasive prenatal testing is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "If you or your child is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, your healthcare team may include a doctor called an endocrinologist who specializes in conditions involving the body's glands and hormones. Your team also may include a speech therapist, a pediatrician, a physical therapist, a genetic counselor, a reproductive medicine or infertility specialist, and a counselor or psychologist.\n",
      "Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help lessen its effects. The earlier the condition is diagnosed and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help.\n",
      "Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome is based on symptoms and may include:\n",
      "- Testosterone therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone therapy can be given to help stimulate changes that typically occur at puberty. These changes include a deeper voice, facial and body hair, bigger muscle mass, and sexual desire. Testosterone therapy also can help bone density. It may help mood, focus and attention too. Testosterone therapy does not help with fertility problems.\n",
      "- Breast tissue removal. If extra breast tissues develops, the tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, if desired.\n",
      "- Therapy. Speech and language therapy can help if there are speech or language problems. Physical therapy can help with motor skills and muscle strength. Occupational therapy can help with social skills and job skills.\n",
      "- Educational evaluation and support. If learning and socializing are a problem, extra services may help. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support is available.\n",
      "- Fertility treatment. Most people with Klinefelter syndrome cannot have biological children because few or no sperm are made in the testicles. For some people who make a small amount of sperm, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is taken from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg.\n",

      "When Cushing syndrome is caused by the body making too much cortisol, it can be hard to diagnose. That's because other illnesses have similar symptoms. Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and complex process. You'll need to see a doctor who specializes in hormonal diseases, called an endocrinologist.\n",
      "The endocrinologist likely will do a physical exam and look for signs of Cushing syndrome, such as a round face, a hump on the back of the neck, and thin, bruised skin with stretch marks.\n",
      "If you haven't been using a glucocorticoid medicine, these tests may help pinpoint the cause of Cushing syndrome:\n",
      "- Urine and blood tests. These tests measure hormone levels and show if the body is making too much cortisol. For the urine test, you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Cortisol, ACTH and other hormones are be measured in urine and blood samples.\n",
      "Your health care provider also might recommend other tests. These tests measure cortisol levels before and after using hormone medicines to trigger or block cortisol.\n",
      "- Saliva test. Cortisol levels typically rise and fall during the day. In people without Cushing syndrome, cortisol drops in the evening. By looking at cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected at night, the health care team can see if cortisol levels are too high.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. CT or MRI scans can take pictures of the pituitary and adrenal glands to see if anything shows up, such as tumors.\n",
      "- Inferior petrosal sinus sampling. This test can help decide if Cushing syndrome is caused by an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma, or ACTH-producing tumor in another organ. For the test, blood samples are taken from the veins that drain the pituitary gland, called the inferior petrosal sinuses.\n",
      "During the test, you are given medicine through a vein to help you stay calm and comfortable. A thin tube is placed in your groin or neck area and is threaded to the inferior petrosal sinuses to collect a blood sample. Another blood sample is taken from your forearm. You are then given a medicine that causes the tumor to make more ACTH, and blood samples are taken again from the same areas. Levels of ACTH are then compared between the two sample areas.\n",
      "If the ACTH level is higher in the sinus sample, the problem is coming from the pituitary. If the ACTH levels are similar between the sinuses and forearm, the problem is outside of the pituitary gland.\n",
      "These tests help your health care provider diagnose Cushing syndrome. They also may help rule out other health conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome — a hormone problem in people with enlarged ovaries. Depression, eating disorders and alcoholism also can have symptoms similar to Cushing syndrome.\n",

      "Chilblains can be treated at home with self-care, including keeping your hands and feet warm and dry. If your chilblains symptoms don't clear up with self-care, your health care provider may suggest medicine, including:\n",
      "- A topical corticosteroid. If your chilblains symptoms include sores, applying a corticosteroid such as triamcinolone 0.1% cream might help clear them up.\n",
      "- Blood pressure medicine. For symptoms that don't respond to other treatment, your health care provider might prescribe a blood pressure medicine such as nifedipine (Procardia). It's a type of calcium channel blocker that treats chilblains by improving blood flow.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Your doctor will start by reviewing your medical history and conducting a physical and neurological examination.\n",
      "To determine if your symptoms are caused by problems in the balance function in your inner ear, your doctor is likely to recommend tests. They might include:\n",
      "- Hearing tests. Difficulties with hearing are frequently associated with balance problems.\n",
      "- Posturography test. Wearing a safety harness, you try to remain standing on a moving platform. A posturography test indicates which parts of your balance system you rely on most.\n",
      "- Electronystagmography and videonystagmography. Both tests record your eye movements, which play a role in vestibular function and balance. Electronystagmography uses electrodes to record eye movements. Videonystagmography uses small cameras to record eye movements.\n",
      "- Rotary chair test. Your eye movements are analyzed while you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves slowly in a circle.\n",
      "- Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Your doctor carefully turns your head in different positions while watching your eye movements to determine whether you have a false sense of motion or spinning.\n",
      "- Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials test. Sensor pads attached to your neck and forehead and under your eyes measure tiny changes in muscle contractions in reaction to sounds.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. MRI and CT scans can determine if underlying medical conditions might be causing your balance problems.\n",
      "- Blood pressure and heart rate tests. Your blood pressure might be checked when sitting and then after standing for two to three minutes to determine if you have significant drops in blood pressure. Your heart rate might be checked when standing to help determine if a heart condition is causing your symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment depends on the cause of your balance problems. Your treatment may include:\n",
      "- Balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation). Therapists trained in balance problems design a customized program of balance retraining and exercises. Therapy can help you compensate for imbalance, adapt to less balance and maintain physical activity. To prevent falls, your therapist might recommend a balance aid, such as a cane, and ways to reduce your risk of falls in your home.\n",
      "- Positioning procedures. If you have BPPV, a therapist might conduct a procedure (canalith repositioning) that clears particles out of your inner ear and deposits them into a different area of your ear. The procedure involves maneuvering the position of your head.\n",
      "- Diet and lifestyle changes. If you have Meniere's disease or migraines, dietary changes are often suggested that can ease symptoms. You may need to limit salt intake and avoid other dietary triggers such as caffeine, alcohol and certain ingredients. If you experience postural hypotension, you might need to drink more fluids or wear compression stockings.\n",
      "- Medications. If you have severe vertigo that lasts hours or days, you might be prescribed medications that can control dizziness and vomiting.\n",
      "- Surgery. If you have Meniere's disease or acoustic neuroma, your treatment team may recommend surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery might be an option for some people with acoustic neuroma. This procedure delivers radiation precisely to your tumor and doesn't require an incision.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Diagnosing the cause of itchy skin starts with a physical exam and questions about your medical history. If your health care provider thinks your itchy skin is the result of a medical condition, you might have tests, including:\n",
      "- Blood test. A complete blood count can provide evidence of an internal condition causing your itch, such as anemia.\n",
      "- Tests of liver and kidney function. Liver or kidney disorders and thyroid conditions, such as hyperthyroidism, can cause itching.\n",
      "- Chest X-rays. A chest X-ray can show if you have enlarged lymph nodes, which can go along with itchy skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Itchy skin treatment focuses on removing the cause of the itch. If home remedies don't ease your symptoms, your health care provider may recommend prescription medicine or other treatments. Controlling itchy skin symptoms can be challenging and may require long-term therapy. Options include:\n",
      "- Corticosteroid creams and ointments. If your skin is itchy and inflamed, your health care provider may suggest applying a medicated cream or ointment to the affected areas. You might then cover the treated skin with damp cotton material. Moisture helps the skin absorb the cream and has a cooling effect.\n",
      "If you have severe or long-term itching, your health care provider might suggest this bedtime routine: Bathe in plain lukewarm water for 20 minutes, and then apply triamcinolone .025% to 0.1% ointment to the wet skin. This traps the moisture and helps the medicine absorb. Then put on pajamas. Repeat this routine at bedtime for several nights.\n",
      "- Other creams and ointments. Other treatments that you apply to your skin include calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). Or you may find some relief with topical anesthetics, capsaicin cream or doxepin cream.\n",
      "- Oral medicines. Antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be helpful in easing some types of long-term itch. Examples of SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). Another option is a tricyclic antidepressants, such as doxepin, You may not feel the full benefit of some of these medicines until 8 to 12 weeks after starting treatment.\n",
      "- Light therapy (phototherapy). Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to a specific type of light. This can be a good option for people who can't take oral medicines. You'll likely need a few phototherapy sessions, until the itching is under control.\n",

      "- Laser and radiofrequency treatments. Various wounding (ablative) laser treatments are available to treat cellulite. In one method, a thin fiber is slipped under the skin to deliver laser heat that destroys the fibrous bands binding fat. This approach has shown to reduce the appearance of cellulite for six months to a year. Further study is needed.\n",
      "There's also a device that uses heat (radiofrequency) for nonablative treatment that improves how the skin looks. You'll likely need several sessions before you notice an improvement in the appearance of your skin. Nonablative treatments typically need to be repeated more often than do ablative treatments.\n",
      "- Acoustic wave therapy. With this technique, a technician applies gel to the affected skin and runs a small, hand-held device (transducer) over the area. The transducer sends sound waves into your body, breaking up cellulite. You'll likely need several sessions before you notice an improvement in the appearance of your skin.\n",
      "- Massage. Some cellulite treatments are based on the concept that vigorous massage will increase lymphatic flow, remove toxins and reduce excess fluid in cellulite-prone areas. One method uses a hand-held machine to knead the skin between rollers (Endermologie). Endermologie has FDA approval as a medical device with little potential to cause harm. You might notice a slight improvement to your skin after a number of sessions. The results are short-lived.\n",
      "- Surgery. Your doctor may offer one of various procedures that use needles, blades or other special tools to separate the fibrous bands under the skin (subcision) in an effort to smooth the skin. One method also uses fat grafting to improve skin appearance. Results from these techniques may last two to three years.\n",

The exercises strengthen and stretch your shoulder muscles to open the thoracic outlet. This improves your range of motion and posture. These exercises, done over time, may take the pressure off the blood vessels and nerves in the thoracic outlet.\n",
      "- Medicines. You may be prescribed anti-inflammatory medicines, pain medicines or muscle relaxants. The medicines reduce swelling, reduce pain and encourage muscle relaxation. If there is a blood clot, you may need a blood-thinning medicine.\n",
      "- Clot-dissolving medicines. If you have venous or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome and have blood clots, you may be given a medicine to dissolve the clots. The medicine, known as thrombolytics, goes into your veins or arteries to dissolve blood clots. After you're given thrombolytics, your healthcare professional may prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots, known as anticoagulants.\n",

      "If you have a chronic respiratory disease, your health care provider may prescribe medications to help relieve your symptoms.\n",
      "Health care providers may prescribe antiviral drugs within the first day or two of symptoms. They can reduce the severity of symptoms and may lower the risk of complications.\n",

      "- Known exposure. Details about distance from the source of radiation and duration of exposure can help provide a rough estimate of the severity of radiation sickness.\n",
      "- Vomiting and other symptoms. The time between radiation exposure and when vomiting starts is a fairly accurate screening tool to estimate absorbed radiation dose. The shorter the time before vomiting starts, the higher the dose. The severity and timing of other symptoms also may help medical personnel determine the absorbed dose.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Frequent blood tests over several days enable medical personnel to look for drops in disease-fighting white blood cells and unusual changes in the DNA of blood cells. These factors indicate the degree of bone marrow damage, which is determined by the level of an absorbed dose.\n",

      "- Urine tests. A lab can check a sample of your urine under a microscope. This is done to find out how well your kidneys are working and how much protein the kidneys are spilling. With IgA nephropathy, the lab exam shows blood in the urine or other signs that could hint at inflammation of the tiny filters in the kidneys, called glomeruli.\n",
      "- Blood tests. If you have kidney disease, blood tests might show higher levels of the waste product creatinine or the protein cystatin C.\n",
      "- Kidney biopsy. This procedure is the only way to confirm whether you have IgA nephropathy. A special needle is used to take out small pieces of kidney tissue. Then the tissue is checked under a microscope.\n",

      "- Medicines that calm the immune system. These also are called immunosuppressants. They include corticosteroids and other strong medicines that can lessen the body's defenses. They might keep the immune system from making the proteins that attack the glomeruli. These medicines can cause serious side effects, such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar and a greater risk of infection. Your doctor helps you choose an immunosuppressant medicine. Many new treatments have been approved or are being tested in clinical trials. Talk with your doctor about the latest advances in the treatment of IgA nephropathy.\n",

      "Many types of treatment exist for acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML. Treatment depends on several factors, including the subtype of the disease, your age, your overall health, your prognosis and your preferences.\n",
      "Treatment usually has two phases:\n",
      "- Remission induction therapy. This first phase aims to kill the leukemia cells in your blood and bone marrow. But it doesn't usually destroy all the leukemia cells. You will need further treatment to keep the disease from coming back.\n",
      "- Consolidation therapy. This phase also is called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy. It aims to kill the remaining leukemia cells. Consolidation therapy is crucial to helping lower the risk of relapse.\n",
      "Treatments include:\n",
      "Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form. Chemotherapy is the main type of remission induction therapy. It also may be used for consolidation therapy.\n",
      "People with AML usually stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the medicines kill many healthy blood cells while destroying leukemia cells. If the first chemotherapy cycle doesn't cause remission, it can be repeated.\n",
      "Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the medicines you're given. Common side effects are nausea and hair loss. Serious, long-term complications may include heart disease, lung damage, fertility problems and other cancers.\n",
      "Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy during induction therapy.\n",
      "Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, involves putting healthy bone marrow stem cells into the body. These cells replace cells hurt by chemotherapy and other treatments. A bone marrow stem cell transplant may be used for both remission induction and consolidation therapy.\n",
      "Before a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor. This is called an allogeneic transplant.\n",
      "There is an increased risk of infection after a transplant.\n",

      "Tests used to diagnose diabetes insipidus include:\n",
      "- Water deprivation test. For this test, you stop drinking fluids for several hours. During the test, your health care provider measures changes in your body weight, how much urine your body makes, and the concentration of your urine and blood. Your health care provider also may measure the amount of ADH in your blood.\n",
      "During this test, you may receive a manufactured form of ADH. That can help show if your body is making enough ADH and if your kidneys can respond as expected to ADH.\n",
      "- Urine test. Testing urine to see if it contains too much water can be helpful in identifying diabetes insipidus.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Checking the levels of certain substances in the blood, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, can help with a diagnosis and may be useful in identifying the type of diabetes insipidus.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI can look for problems with the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. This imaging test uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the brain.\n",
      "- Genetic testing. If other people in your family have had problems with too much urination or have been diagnosed with diabetes insipidus, your health care provider may suggest genetic testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "If you have mild diabetes insipidus, you may only need to drink more water to avoid dehydration. In other cases, treatment typically is based on the type of diabetes insipidus.\n",
      "- Central diabetes insipidus. If central diabetes insipidus is caused by a disorder in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, such as a tumor, that disorder is treated first.\n",
      "When treatment is needed beyond that, a manufactured hormone called desmopressin (DDAVP, Nocdurna) is used. This medication replaces the missing antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and lowers the amount of urine the body makes. Desmopressin is available as a pill, as a nasal spray and as a shot.\n",
      "If you have central diabetes insipidus, it's likely that your body still makes some ADH. But the amount can change from day to day. That means the amount of desmopressin that you need also may change. Taking more desmopressin than you need can cause water retention. In some cases, it may cause potentially serious low sodium levels in the blood. Talk to your health care provider about how and when to adjust your dosage of desmopressin.\n",
      "- Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Because the kidneys don't properly respond to ADH in this form of diabetes insipidus, desmopressin won't help. Instead, your health care provider may advise you to eat a low-salt diet to lower the amount of urine your kidneys make.\n",
      "Treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide) may ease your symptoms. Although hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic — a type of medicine that causes the body to make more urine — it can lower urine output for some people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n",
      "If your symptoms are due to medicines you're taking, stopping those medicines may help. But don't stop taking any medicine without first talking to your health care provider.\n",
      "- Gestational diabetes insipidus. Treatment for gestational diabetes insipidus involves taking the manufactured hormone desmopressin.\n",
      "- Primary polydipsia. There is no specific treatment for this form of diabetes insipidus other than lowering the amount of fluids you drink. If the condition is related to a mental illness, treating that may ease symptoms.\n",

      "- Physical exam. Your health care provider will examine your neck to feel for changes in your thyroid, such as a lump (nodule) in the thyroid. The provider may also ask about your risk factors, such as past exposure to radiation and a family history of thyroid cancers.\n",
      "- Thyroid function blood tests. Tests that measure blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and hormones produced by your thyroid gland might give your health care team clues about the health of your thyroid.\n",
      "- Ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create pictures of body structures. To create an image of the thyroid, the ultrasound transducer is placed on your lower neck.\n",
      "The way a thyroid nodule looks on an ultrasound image helps your provider determine if it's likely to be cancer. Signs that a thyroid nodule is more likely to be cancerous include calcium deposits (microcalcifications) within the nodule and an irregular border around the nodule. If there's a high likelihood that a nodule might be cancerous, additional tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine what type of thyroid cancer is present.\n",
      "Your provider may also use ultrasound to create images of the lymph nodes in the neck (lymph node mapping) to look for signs of cancer.\n",
      "- Removing a sample of thyroid tissue. During a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, your provider inserts a long, thin needle through your skin and into the thyroid nodule. Ultrasound imaging is typically used to precisely guide the needle. Your provider uses the needle to remove some cells from the thyroid. The sample is sent to a lab for analysis.\n",
      "In the lab, a doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and body tissue (pathologist) examines the tissue sample under a microscope and determines whether cancer is present. The results aren't always clear. Some types of thyroid cancer, particularly follicular thyroid cancer and Hurthle cell thyroid cancer, are more likely to have uncertain results (indeterminate thyroid nodules). Your provider may recommend another biopsy procedure or an operation to remove the thyroid nodule for testing. Specialized tests of the cells to look for gene changes (molecular marker testing) also can be helpful.\n",
      "- An imaging test that uses a radioactive tracer. A radioactive iodine scan uses a radioactive form of iodine and a special camera to detect thyroid cancer cells in your body. It's most often used after surgery to find any cancer cells that might remain. This test is most helpful for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers.\n",
      "Healthy thyroid cells absorb and use iodine from the blood. Some types of thyroid cancer cells do this, too. When the radioactive iodine is injected in a vein or swallowed, any thyroid cancer cells in the body will take up the iodine. Any cells that take up the iodine are shown on the radioactive iodine scan images.\n",
      "- Other imaging tests. You may have one or more imaging tests to help your provider determine whether your cancer has spread beyond the thyroid. Imaging tests may include ultrasound, CT and MRI.\n",
      "- Genetic testing. A portion of medullary thyroid cancers are caused by inherited genes that are passed from parents to children. If you're diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer, your provider may recommend meeting with a genetic counselor to consider genetic testing. Knowing that you have an inherited gene can help you understand your risk of other types of cancer and what your inherited gene may mean for your children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Your thyroid cancer treatment options depend on the type and stage of your thyroid cancer, your overall health, and your preferences.\n",

      "- Develop effective communication.\n",
      "- Participate fully in school, work and social activities.\n",
      "A few examples of treatment methods include:\n",
      "- Speech therapy. Speech therapy can teach you to slow down your speech and learn to notice when you stutter. You may speak very slowly and carefully when beginning speech therapy. Over time, you can work up to a more natural speech pattern.\n",
      "- Electronic devices. Many electronic devices are available to improve fluency. With one device, you'll hear delayed feedback that requires you to slow your speech or the speech will sound distorted through the machine. Another device copies your speech so that it sounds as if you're talking along with someone else. Some electronic devices are small enough to wear during daily activities. Ask a speech-language pathologist for guidance on choosing a device.\n",
      "- Cognitive behavioral therapy. This type of mental health therapy, also called psychotherapy, can help you learn to identify and change ways of thinking that might make stuttering worse. It also can help you get rid of or improve problems with stress, anxiety or self-esteem related to stuttering.\n",
      "- Parent-child interaction. Practicing techniques at home with your child is a key part of helping your child cope with stuttering, especially with some treatment methods. Follow the guidance of the speech-language pathologist to decide on the best method for your child.\n",

While the condition can't be treated before birth, knowing about the condition may give you time to learn more about clubfoot. You'll have time to talk with health experts, such as a pediatric orthopedic surgeon, to plan treatment. If needed, a medical genetics counselor can talk with you about genetic test results and your risk of having a baby with clubfoot in future pregnancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Because a newborn's bones, joints and tendons are very flexible, treatment for clubfoot usually begins in the first week or two after birth. The goals of treatment are to move the child's foot into a corrected position with the bottom of the foot facing the ground. Treatment with casting allows for the best movement of the foot and best long-term results. Treatment is most effective if done in the first few months of age.\n",
      "Treatment options include:\n",
      "- Stretching and casting, called the Ponseti method.\n",
      "- Stretching, splinting and taping, called the French method.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "People often don't seek treatment for hoarding disorder, but rather for other issues, such as depression, anxiety or relationship problems. To help diagnose hoarding disorder, it's best to see a mental health provider who has expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. You'll have a mental health exam that includes questions about emotional well-being. You'll likely be asked about your beliefs and behaviors related to getting and saving items and the impact clutter may have on your quality of life.\n",
      "Your mental health provider may ask your permission to talk with relatives and friends. Pictures and videos of your living spaces and storage areas affected by clutter are often helpful. You also may be asked questions to find out if you have symptoms of other mental health conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment of hoarding disorder can be challenging but effective if you keep working on learning new skills. Some people don't recognize the negative impact of hoarding on their lives or don't believe they need treatment. This is especially true if the possessions or animals offer comfort. If these possessions or animals are taken away, people will often react with frustration and anger. They may quickly collect more to help satisfy emotional needs.\n",
      "The main treatment for hoarding disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a skills-based approach to therapy. You learn how to better manage beliefs and behaviors that are linked to keeping the clutter. Your provider also may prescribe medicines, especially if you have anxiety or depression along with hoarding disorder.\n",

Avoid alcohol while using this medicine and for a full day afterward. It might cause nausea or stomach pain. Check the instructions on the product.\n",
      "- Clindamycin (Cleocin, Clindesse, others). This medicine comes as a cream that you insert into the vagina. Or you can use the pill or suppository form. The cream and suppositories may weaken latex condoms. Avoid sex during treatment and for at least three days after you stop using the medicine. Or use another method of birth control.\n",
      "- Tinidazole (Tindamax). You take this medicine by mouth. It can cause stomach upset. So avoid alcohol during treatment and for at least three days after completing treatment.\n",
      "- Secnidazole (Solosec). This is an antibiotic you eat one time with food. It comes as a packet of granules that you sprinkle onto a soft food, such as applesauce, pudding or yogurt. You eat the mixture within 30 minutes. But take care not to crunch or chew the granules.\n",
      "Usually, treatment isn't needed for a sex partner whose sex is male. But BV can spread to partners whose sex is female. So testing and treatment may be needed if a female partner has symptoms.\n",
      "Take your medicine or use the cream or gel for as long as prescribed, even if your symptoms go away. If you stop treatment early, BV may come back. This is called recurrent bacterial vaginosis.\n",

      "- Measuring the pocket depth of the groove between your gums and teeth. A dental probe is inserted beside your tooth beneath your gumline, usually at several sites in your mouth. In a healthy mouth, the pocket depth is between 1 and 3 millimeters (mm). Pockets deeper than 4 mm may mean gum disease.\n",
      "- Dental X-rays to check for bone loss in areas where your dentist sees deeper pockets.\n",
      "- Other tests as needed. If it's not clear what has caused your gingivitis, your dentist may recommend that you get a medical evaluation to check for other health conditions.

      "- Dental cleaning. Your first professional cleaning will include the removal of all traces of plaque, tartar and bacterial products. This procedure is known as scaling and root planing. Scaling removes tartar and bacteria from the surface of your teeth and under your gums. Root planing removes the bacterial products produced by swelling and irritation, and it smooths the root surfaces. This discourages further buildup of tartar and bacteria, and it allows proper healing. The procedure may be done using instruments, a laser or an ultrasonic device.\n",
      "- Any needed dental repairs. Crooked teeth or poorly fitting crowns, bridges or other dental repairs may irritate your gums and make it harder to remove plaque during daily oral care. If problems with your teeth or dental repairs play a part in your gingivitis, your dentist may recommend fixing these problems.\n",

A wandlike device called a transducer sends high-frequency sound waves into the neck. The sound waves pass through the tissue and create images on a screen. The images can show narrowing or clotting in the carotid arteries.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) scans. CT scans of the head use X-ray beams to create a 3D image. This allows your healthcare professional to look at the brain or the arteries in the neck and brain. A CTA scan may involve an injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel. Unlike a carotid ultrasound, a CTA scan can look at blood vessels in the neck and head.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These tests use a strong magnetic field to create a 3D view of the brain. MRA uses technology similar to MRI to look at the arteries in the neck and brain. But an MRA may include an injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel.\n",
      "- Echocardiography. This test may be done to find out if a heart issue caused fragments in the blood that led to a blockage. A traditional echocardiography is called a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A TTE involves moving an instrument called a transducer across the chest to look at the heart. The transducer emits sound waves that bounce off different parts of the heart, creating an ultrasound image.\n",
      "Or you may need another type of echocardiography called a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). A flexible probe with a transducer is placed into the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, known as the esophagus. Because the esophagus is directly behind the heart, a TEE can create clearer, detailed ultrasound images. This allows a better view of some things, such as blood clots, that might not be seen clearly in a traditional echocardiography exam.\n",
      "- Arteriography. This procedure is used in some people to get a view of arteries in the brain not usually seen in an X-ray. A radiologist inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a small incision, usually in the groin.\n",
      "The catheter is guided through the major arteries and into the carotid or vertebral artery in the neck. Then a dye is injected through the catheter. The dye allows the arteries to be seen on X-ray images.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Once your healthcare professional learns the cause of the transient ischemic attack, the goal of treatment is to correct the issue and prevent a stroke. You may need medicines to prevent blood clots. Or you might need surgery.\n",

Some people with eosinophilic esophagitis will have an esophagus that looks typical.\n",
      "- Biopsy. During an endoscopy, a biopsy of your esophagus will be done. A biopsy involves taking a small bit of tissue. Multiple tissue samples will likely be taken from your esophagus and then examined under a microscope for eosinophils.\n",
      "- Blood tests. If eosinophilic esophagitis is suspected, you may undergo some additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests look for the sources of your allergic reaction, also called allergens. You may be given blood tests to look for higher than usual eosinophil counts or total immunoglobulin E levels, suggesting an allergy.\n",
      "- Esophageal sponge. This test is performed in the health care provider's office. It involves swallowing a capsule attached to a string.

      "- Drink cool fluids. Stick to water or sports drinks. Don't drink any alcoholic beverages, which can add to dehydration.\n",
      "- Try cooling measures. If possible, take a cool shower, soak in a cool bath or put towels soaked in cool water on your skin. If you're outdoors and not near shelter, soaking in a cool pond or stream can help bring your temperature down.\n",
      "- Loosen clothing. Remove any unnecessary clothing and make sure your clothes are lightweight and nonbinding.\n",

      "- Use evaporation cooling techniques. If cold water immersion is not an option, health care professionals may try to lower your body temperature using an evaporation method. Cool water is misted on your body while warm air is fanned over you. This causes the water to evaporate and cool your skin.\n",
      "- Pack you with ice and cooling blankets. Another method to lower your temperature is to wrap you in a special cooling blanket and apply ice packs to your groin, neck, back and armpits.\n",

Although surgery is rarely part of treatment for eye problems related to albinism, your ophthalmologist may recommend surgery on eye muscles to reduce nystagmus. Surgery to correct strabismus may make the condition less noticeable.\n",
      "- Skin care and prevention of skin cancer. This includes receiving a skin exam at least every year to screen for skin cancer or spots that can lead to cancer.

      "To determine whether you have a cataract, your eye doctor will review your medical history and symptoms. They also will perform an eye exam. Your doctor may do several tests, including:\n",
      "- Vision test. A vision test, also called a visual acuity test, uses an eye chart to measure how well you can read a series of letters. One eye is tested at a time, while the other eye is covered. A chart or a viewing device with letters that get smaller is used. With this, your eye doctor determines if you have 20/20 vision or if you have trouble seeing.\n",
      "- Eye structure exam. An eye structure exam, also called a slit lamp, allows your eye doctor to see the structures at the front of your eye up close. It's called a slit lamp because it uses an intense line of light, a slit, to light up the structures in your eye. The slit allows your doctor to view these structures in small sections. This makes it easier to find anything that may be wrong.\n",
      "- Retinal exam. A retinal exam looks at the back of your eyes, called the retina. To prepare for a retinal exam, your eye doctor puts drops in your eyes to open your pupils wide, called dilation. This makes it easier to see the retina. Using a slit lamp or a special device called an ophthalmoscope, your eye doctor can examine your lens for signs of a cataract.\n",
      "- Fluid pressure test. This test, also called applanation tonometry, measures fluid pressure in your eye. There are multiple different devices available to do this.\n",

      "When you're ready to begin preventive therapy, your doctor may recommend:\n",
      "- Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants — such as nortriptyline (Pamelor) — can be used to treat chronic headaches. These medications can also help treat the depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances that often accompany chronic daily headaches.\n",
      "Other antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, others), might help in treating depression and anxiety, but have not been shown to be more effective than placebo for headaches.\n",
      "- Beta blockers. These drugs, commonly used to treat high blood pressure, are also a mainstay for preventing episodic migraines. These include atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL) and propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL).\n",
      "- Anti-seizure medications. Some anti-seizure drugs seem to prevent migraines and might be used to prevent chronic daily headaches, as well. Options include topiramate (Topamax, Qudexy XR, others), divalproex sodium (Depakote) and gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise).\n",
      "- NSAIDs. Prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — such as naproxen sodium (Anaprox, Naprelan) — might be helpful, especially if you're withdrawing from other pain relievers. They can also be used periodically when the headache is more severe.\n",
      "- Botulinum toxin. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections provide relief for some people and might be a viable option for people who don't tolerate daily medication well. Botox would most likely be considered if the headaches have features of chronic migraines.\n",

DNA tests can show carriers for all types of Niemann-Pick disease if the gene changes have been identified in the first person in a family to have the condition. The gene change can be passed on to children.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI of the brain may show loss of brain cells. But in the early stages of Niemann-Pick disease, an MRI may not show any changes because symptoms usually show up before the loss of brain cells. MRI also can be used to look at the liver and spleen to see if they are large and to measure their size.\n",
      "- Eye exam. An eye exam may show changes that could be caused by Niemann-Pick disease, such as problems with eye movements in type C and changes inside the eyes in types A and B.\n",
      "- Prenatal testing. Ultrasound during pregnancy can show the large liver and spleen caused by Niemann-Pick disease type C.

      "Tests and procedures used to diagnose glioma include:\n",
      "- An exam to test your nerves and brain function. A neurological exam involves checking your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes. If there's difficulty with a certain task, it might be a clue that there could be a brain tumor.\n",
      "- Tests to make pictures of the brain. Imaging tests create pictures of your brain to look for signs of a brain tumor. MRI is the imaging test used most often. Sometimes you have an injection of dye in a vein before your MRI. This helps create better pictures.\n",
      "Other imaging tests may include CT and positron emission tomography, which is also called a PET scan.\n",
      "- A procedure to get a sample of tissue for testing. Sometimes a procedure called a biopsy is needed to remove some of the tissue for testing before treatment begins. It's used when surgery isn't an option for removing the brain tumor. If you will have surgery to remove your brain tumor, you might not need a biopsy before your surgery.\n",
      "To get the tissue sample, a needle might be used. The needle is guided by imaging tests. This procedure is called stereotactic needle biopsy. During the procedure, a small hole is made in the skull. A thin needle is then inserted through the hole. Tissue is removed using the needle and sent to a lab for testing.\n",
      "- Tests on tumor cells. A sample of the brain tumor may be sent to a lab for testing. The sample can come from a biopsy procedure. Or the sample can be taken during surgery to remove the glioma.\n",
      "The sample is sent to a lab where it's tested by doctors who specialize in analyzing blood and body tissue. These doctors are called pathologists.\n",
      "Tests in the lab can determine if you have a glioma and what type you have. Other tests might show how quickly the glioma cells are growing. Advanced tests look at what DNA changes are present in the glioma cells. The test results help your health care team confirm your diagnosis and create a treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Glioma treatment usually begins with surgery. But surgery isn't always an option. For example, if the glioma grows into important parts of the brain, it might be too risky to remove all of the glioma. Other treatments, such as radiation therapy and chemotherapy, might be recommended as the first treatment.\n",
      "Which treatments are best for you will depend on your particular situation. Your health care team considers the type of glioma, its size and where it's located in the brain. Your treatment plan also depends on your health and your preferences.\n",

      "- Skin prick test. Small amounts of material that can trigger allergies are pricked into patches of skin on the arm or upper back. A medical professional then watches the skin for an allergic reaction. If someone has an allergy, a raised bump called a hive forms at the site of that allergen. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests.\n",
      "- Allergy blood test. A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure the immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in the bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Once someone knows their allergy triggers, a healthcare professional can help develop a treatment plan to reduce or get rid of hay fever symptoms.\n",

      "Tests and procedures used to diagnose acute lymphocytic leukemia include:\n",
      "- Blood tests. Blood tests may reveal too many or too few white blood cells, not enough red blood cells, and not enough platelets. A blood test may also show the presence of blast cells — immature cells normally found in the bone marrow.\n",
      "- Bone marrow test. During bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, a needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the hipbone or breastbone. The sample is sent to a lab for testing to look for leukemia cells.\n",
      "Doctors in the lab will classify blood cells into specific types based on their size, shape, and other genetic or molecular features. They also look for certain changes in the cancer cells and determine whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes. This information helps your doctor develop a treatment plan.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. Imaging tests such as an X-ray, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound scan may help determine whether cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body.\n",
      "- Spinal fluid test. A lumbar puncture test, also called a spinal tap, may be used to collect a sample of spinal fluid — the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The sample is tested to see whether cancer cells have spread to the spinal fluid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "In general, treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia falls into separate phases:\n",
      "- Induction therapy. The purpose of the first phase of treatment is to kill most of the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow and to restore normal blood cell production.\n",
      "- Consolidation therapy. Also called post-remission therapy, this phase of treatment is aimed at destroying any remaining leukemia in the body.\n",
      "- Maintenance therapy. The third phase of treatment prevents leukemia cells from regrowing. The treatments used in this stage are usually given at much lower doses over a long period of time, often years.\n",
      "- Preventive treatment to the spinal cord. During each phase of therapy, people with acute lymphocytic leukemia may receive additional treatment to kill leukemia cells located in the central nervous system. In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\n",
      "Depending on your situation, the phases of treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can span two to three years.\n",
      "Treatments may include:\n",
      "- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\n",
      "- Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\n",
      "- Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\n",
      "A bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\n",
      "- Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body.\n",
      "CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for children and young adults. It might be used for consolidation therapy or for treating relapse.\n",
      "- Clinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments. While clinical trials give you or your child a chance to try the latest cancer treatment, the benefits and risks of the treatment may be uncertain. Discuss the benefits and risks of clinical trials with your doctor.\n",

      "- Physical exam. Your healthcare professional may do a physical exam to identify any conditions that may be confused with sleepwalking, such as nighttime seizures, other sleep disorders or panic attacks.\n",
      "- Discussion of your symptoms. Unless you live alone and aren't aware of your sleepwalking, you'll likely be told by others that you sleepwalk. If your sleep partner comes with you to the appointment, your healthcare professional may ask your sleep partner whether you appear to sleepwalk. Your healthcare professional also may ask you and your sleep partner to fill out a questionnaire about your sleep behaviors. Tell your healthcare professional if you have a family history of sleepwalking.\n",
      "- Sleep study. In some cases, your healthcare professional may recommend an overnight study in a sleep lab. This sleep study is called a polysomnography. Sensors placed on your body will record and keep track of your brain waves, the oxygen level in your blood, heart rate and breathing, as well as eye and leg movements, while you sleep. You may be videotaped to document your behavior during sleep cycles.\n",

      "Treatment may include:\n",
      "- Treating any underlying condition, if the sleepwalking is related to not getting enough sleep or an underlying sleep disorder or medical condition.\n",
      "- Adjusting medicine, if it's thought that the sleepwalking is due to a drug.\n",
      "- Anticipatory awakenings, which involves waking people up about 15 minutes before they usually sleepwalk, then staying awake for a few minutes before falling asleep again.\n",
      "- Medicine such as benzodiazepines, which slow down activity in the nervous system, or certain antidepressants.\n",
      "- Learning self-hypnosis from a trained professional who is familiar with parasomnias. People who are open to suggestions during hypnosis may achieve a deep state of relaxation that could change unwanted activities during sleep.\n",

      "Although specific treatments vary depending on symptoms, most children with Prader-Willi syndrome will need:\n",
      "- Good nutrition. Many infants with Prader-Willi syndrome have a hard time feeding because they have less muscle tone. Your child's healthcare professional may recommend a high-calorie formula or special feeding methods to help your baby gain weight. They will monitor your child's growth.\n",
      "- Human growth hormone (HGH) treatment. HGH treatment helps infants and children with Prader-Willi syndrome grow. It also makes muscle tone better and lowers body fat. HGH also may be used in adults. A doctor who treats hormonal conditions, also known as an endocrinologist, can help find out whether your child would benefit from HGH and talk about any risks.\n",
      "- Sex hormone treatment. Your endocrinologist may suggest that your child take hormone replacement therapy — testosterone for males or estrogen and progesterone for females — because of low levels of sex hormones. Hormone replacement therapy usually starts when your child reaches the usual age for puberty. It can lower the risk of bone thinning, also known as osteoporosis. Your child may need surgery to correct undescended testicles.\n",
      "- Weight management. A dietitian can help you create a healthy, reduced-calorie diet to help manage your child's weight while ensuring proper nutrition. A restricted-calorie diet may require supplemental vitamins or minerals to ensure balanced nutrition. Being more physically active and exercising can help manage weight and make your child better able to function physically.\n",
      "- Treatment of sleep disturbances. Treating sleep apnea and other sleep problems can improve daytime sleepiness and behavioral issues.\n",
      "- Various therapies. Your child likely will benefit from a range of therapies. These include physical therapy to make movement skills and strength better, speech therapy to make verbal skills better, and occupational therapy to learn everyday skills. Developmental therapy to learn age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills also may help. In the U.S., early intervention programs with these types of therapy usually are available for infants and toddlers through a state's health department. During school years, educational planning and support can improve learning.\n",
      "- Behavior management. You may need to create schedules for your child and set strict limits on access to food and how much food is eaten. It's important to be clear on what you expect in terms of your child's behavior. Sometimes medicine is needed to manage behavioral problems.\n",
      "- Mental healthcare. A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or a psychiatrist, may help with mental health problems, such as obsessive-compulsive behaviors, skin picking, anxiety or a mood condition. Medicine may ease mental health symptoms.\n",

      "Polysomnography can help diagnose central sleep apnea. It also can help rule out other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, repetitive movements during sleep or narcolepsy. These other disorders can cause excessive daytime sleepiness but require different treatment.\n",
      "Doctors trained in nervous system diseases, known as neurologists, and in heart diseases, known as cardiologists, and others might be involved in evaluating your condition. You might need imaging of your head or heart to look for contributing conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatments for central sleep apnea might include:\n",
      "- Addressing associated medical problems. Possible causes of central sleep apnea include other disorders. Treating those conditions might help your central sleep apnea. For example, therapy for heart failure might improve central sleep apnea.\n",
      "- Reduction of opioid medicines. If opioid medicines are causing your central sleep apnea, your health care team might reduce your dose of those medicines over time.\n",
      "- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This method, also used to treat obstructive sleep apnea, involves wearing a mask over the nose or over the nose and mouth while asleep.\n",
      "The mask is attached to a small pump that supplies a continuous amount of pressurized air to hold open the upper airway. CPAP may prevent the airway closure that can trigger central sleep apnea.\n",
      "As with obstructive sleep apnea, in central sleep apnea it's important that you use the CPAP device only as directed. If your mask is uncomfortable or the pressure feels too strong, talk with your health care team. Several types of masks are available. The air pressure also can be adjusted.\n",
      "- Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV). If CPAP doesn't effectively treat your condition, you might be given ASV. Like CPAP, ASV also delivers pressurized air.\n",
      "Unlike CPAP, ASV adjusts the amount of pressure breath-by-breath when you take a breath. This smooths out your breathing pattern. The device also might automatically deliver a breath if you haven't taken a breath within a certain number of seconds.\n",
      "ASV isn't recommended for people with symptomatic heart failure.\n",

Unlike ASV, the amount of pressure delivered when you breathe in is fixed rather than variable. BPAP also can be set to deliver a breath if you haven't taken a breath within a certain number of seconds.\n",

      "Blood tests are particularly important for older adults because they may not have classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Thyroid blood tests may give false results if you take biotin. Biotin is a B vitamin supplement that also may be found in multivitamins. Tell your health care provider if you are taking biotin or a multivitamin with biotin. To make sure your blood test is accurate, your health care provider may ask you to stop taking biotin 3 to 5 days before the test.\n",
      "If blood test results show hyperthyroidism, your health care provider may suggest one of the following tests. They can help find out why your thyroid is overactive.\n",
      "- Radioiodine scan and uptake test. For this test, you take a small, dose of radioactive iodine, called radioiodine, to see how much of it collects in your thyroid gland and where it collects in the gland.\n",
      "If your thyroid gland takes in a high amount of radioiodine, that means your thyroid gland is making too much thyroid hormone. The most likely cause is either Graves' disease or overactive thyroid nodules.\n",
      "If your thyroid gland takes in a low amount of radioiodine, that means hormones stored in the thyroid gland are leaking into the bloodstream. In that case, it's likely that you have thyroiditis.\n",
      "- Thyroid ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the thyroid. Ultrasound may be better at finding thyroid nodules than are other tests. There's no exposure to radiation with this test, so it can be used for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or others who can't take radioiodine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "There are several treatments available for hyperthyroidism. The best approach for you depends on your age and health. The underlying cause of hyperthyroidism and how severe it is make a difference too. Your personal preference also should be considered as you and your health care provider decide on a treatment plan. Treatment may include:\n",
      "- Anti-thyroid medicine. These medications slowly ease symptoms of hyperthyroidism by preventing the thyroid gland from making too many hormones. Anti-thyroid medications include methimazole and propylthiouracil. Symptoms usually begin to improve within several weeks to months.\n",
      "Treatment with anti-thyroid medicine typically lasts 12 to 18 months. After that, the dose may be slowly decreased or stopped if symptoms go away and if blood test results show that thyroid hormone levels have returned to the standard range. For some people, anti-thyroid medicine puts hyperthyroidism into long-term remission. But other people may find that hyperthyroidism comes back after this treatment.\n",
      "Although rare, serious liver damage can happen with both anti-thyroid medications. But because propylthiouracil has caused many more cases of liver damage, it's generally used only when people can't take methimazole. A small number of people who are allergic to these medicines may develop skin rashes, hives, fever or joint pain. They also can raise the risk of infection.\n",
      "- Beta blockers. These medicines don't affect thyroid hormone levels. But they can lessen symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as a tremor, rapid heart rate and heart palpitations. Sometimes, health care providers prescribe them to ease symptoms until thyroid hormones are closer to a standard level. These medicines generally aren't recommended for people who have asthma. Side effects may include fatigue and sexual problems.\n",
      "- Radioiodine therapy. The thyroid gland takes up radioiodine. This treatment causes the gland to shrink. This medicine is taken by mouth. With this treatment, symptoms typically lessen within several months. This treatment usually causes thyroid activity to slow enough to make the thyroid gland underactive. That condition is hypothyroidism. Because of that, over time, you may need to take medicine to replace thyroid hormones.\n",
      "- Thyroidectomy. This is surgery to remove part of or all of the thyroid gland. It is not used often to treat hyperthyroidism. But it may be an option for people who are pregnant. It also may be a choice for those who can't take anti-thyroid medicine and don't want to or can't take radioiodine therapy.\n",
      "Risks of this surgery include damage to the vocal cords and parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands on the back of the thyroid. They help control the level of calcium in the blood.\n",
      "People who have a thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy need lifelong treatment with the medicine levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid, others). It supplies the body with thyroid hormones.

Free tests can be mailed to U.S. addresses, or you can purchase tests in stores, pharmacies or online. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA, approves or authorizes the tests. On the FDA website, you can find a list of the tests that are validated and their expiration dates. You also can check with your healthcare professional before buying a test if you have any concerns.\\nWhen taking a test at home, read the directions that come with the test carefully. Follow the instructions exactly to get as accurate a result as possible.\\nCOVID-19 tests also are available from healthcare professionals, some pharmacies and clinics, or at community testing sites.\\nHere are some guidelines for when to take a COVID-19 test:\\n- If you have COVID-19 symptoms, test for the illness right away.\\n- If you were exposed to the COVID-19 virus but don't have symptoms, wait at least five days after exposure then test.\\n- If you have symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 30 days, you can test again. But if you were just exposed to the coronavirus and don't have symptoms, you don't need to test.\\nAlso, testing before an event or contact with people at high risk of serious illness helps prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\\nCOVID-19 tests use a sample taken from your nose or throat, or a sample of saliva.\\nTwo types of tests can help diagnose COVID-19.\\n- Molecular tests. These tests look for genetic material from the COVID-19 virus.\\nPolymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You may also see this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test.\\nPCR tests are more accurate than the other type of COVID-19 test, called an antigen test.

Your health care professional may ask about other conditions you've had, medicines you take, your stress levels and other issues about your health. They may also review your family's health history to see if you may be more likely to have certain conditions.\\n- A general physical exam. This includes measuring your height; checking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and temperature; listening to your heart and lungs; and examining your abdomen.\\n- Calculating your BMI. Your health care professional checks your body mass index, called BMI. A BMI of 30 or higher is considered obesity. Numbers higher than 30 increase health risks even more. Have your BMI checked at least once a year. This can help pinpoint your overall health risks and what treatments may be right for you.\\n- Measuring your waist size. The distance around your waist is known as the circumference. Fat stored around the waist, sometimes called visceral fat or abdominal fat, may further increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Women with a waist that measures more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) and men with a waist that's more than 40 inches (102 centimeters) around may have more health risks than do people with smaller waist measurements. Like the BMI measurement, waist circumference should be checked at least once a year.\\n- Checking for other health problems. If you have known health problems, your health care team will evaluate them. Your health care professional also will check for other possible health problems, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid, liver problems and diabetes.\\nGathering this information will help you and your health care team choose the type of treatment that will work best for you.\",\n",

Today, healthcare professionals and researchers are able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty.\\nThey do this by using a combination of tests that may include tests for biomarkers. Biomarkers can detect if plaques and tangles are present in the brain. Biomarker tests include specific types of positron emission tomography, also known as PET, scans of the brain.

A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis also involves ruling out other conditions that might produce similar symptoms. This is known as a differential diagnosis.\\nTests used to diagnose MS may include:\\n- MRI, which can reveal areas of MS on the brain and spinal cord. These areas are called lesions. A contrast dye may be given through an IV to highlight lesions that show the disease is in an active phase.\\n- Lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap, in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from the spinal canal for lab testing. This sample can show changes in antibodies that are linked to MS. A spinal tap also can help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to MS. An antibody test that looks for kappa free light chains may be faster and less expensive than previous spinal fluid tests for MS.\\n- Optical coherence tomography, which uses light waves to produce images of the eye. In MS, a condition called optic neuritis causes changes in the retina. Optical coherence tomography may be used to measure thickness of the retina. It also may show damage to the retinal nerve fiber.\\n- Evoked potential tests, which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli. In these tests, you watch a moving visual pattern, as short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways.\\n- Blood tests, which can help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to MS. Tests to check for specific biomarkers linked to MS are being developed. These tests may help with diagnosing the disease.\\n- Neuropsychological testing. Neuropsychological testing involves looking at how your brain is working. Testing examines your thinking, memory, language and social skills. It also assesses your personality and mood. A psychologist with specific expertise, known as a neuropsychologist, does this testing. Neuropsychological testing is important in MS because most people with the disease have cognitive impairment. This can include memory loss and trouble with language and thinking skills that affect daily activities. Your healthcare professional may give you a baseline test soon after you are diagnosed.

A shorter, simpler course of treatment may be available.\\nAlso, it's important to avoid sexual activity until seven days after you've completed antibiotic treatment and any sores have healed.\\nExperts also suggest people diagnosed with chlamydia be retested three months after treatment because there's a high chance of reinfection.\\n- Antiviral drugs. If you have herpes or HIV, your doctor may prescribe medicine that keeps a viral infection from getting worse, called an antiviral medicine.\\nYou'll generally have fewer herpes recurrences if you take what's called daily suppressive therapy with a prescription antiviral medicine. But it's still possible to give your partner herpes.\\nAntiviral medicines can keep HIV infection in check for many years.

Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells.\\nDepending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein.\\n- Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you.\\n- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body.\\nYou may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a bone marrow transplant.\\n- Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, helps reestablish healthy stem cells by replacing unhealthy bone marrow with leukemia-free stem cells that will regenerate healthy bone marrow.\\nPrior to a bone marrow transplant, you receive very high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your leukemia-producing bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help rebuild your bone marrow.\\nYou may receive stem cells from a donor or you may be able to use your own stem cells.\\n- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.\\n- Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia. A specialized treatment called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy takes your body's germ-fighting T cells, engineers them to fight cancer and infuses them back into your body. CAR-T cell therapy might be an option for certain types of leukemia.\\n- Clinical trials. Clinical trials are experiments to test new cancer treatments and new ways of using existing treatments.

Treatment may take weeks or months. Even if warts clear up with treatment, they tend to come back or spread. Your healthcare professional will likely suggest starting treatment with the least painful method, particularly when treating young children.\\nTreatment for common warts includes the following approaches. Which is best for you depends on the where the wart is, your symptoms and your preferences. These methods are sometimes combined with home treatments.\\n- Prescription-strength peeling medicine. Wart medicines with salicylic acid work by removing layers of a wart a little bit at a time. Studies show that salicylic acid is more effective when combined with freezing or pulsed-dye laser treatment.\\n- 5-fluoruracil. This wart medicine is applied directly to the wart and keep under a bandage for 12 weeks. This method is often used with good results in children.\\n- Candida antigen. This method works by injecting candida antigen into a wart. It stimulates the immune system to fight warts, even those not close to the injection site. This is an off-label use of this medicine, which means that it doesn't have FDA approval for removing warts. This method is often used with good results for people whose warts haven't responded to other treatments.\\n- Freezing. Freezing therapy administered at the office of a healthcare professional involves applying liquid nitrogen to a wart. This method also is called cryotherapy. It works by causing a blister to form under and around the wart, killing the tissue. The dead tissue sloughs off in a week or so. You'll likely need repeat treatments.\\nSide effects of cryotherapy include pain, blistering and scarring. Because this technique can be painful, it usually isn't used to treat the warts of young children.\\n- Other acids. If salicylic acid or freezing isn't working, your healthcare professional might suggest trichloroacetic acid or other acids. With this method, the wart is shaved and then the acid is applied with a wooden toothpick. You'll need repeat treatments every week or so until the wart goes away.\\nSide effects are burning, stinging and changes in skin color.\\n- Remove wart tissue. Your healthcare professional can use a special tool to remove part of the wart. This tool is called a curet. This treatment may be combined with other methods. The wart may return in the same area.\\n- Laser treatment. If other methods haven't worked, your healthcare professional might suggest laser treatment. This type of treatment is also called photo-based therapy. Examples include carbon dioxide laser, pulsed-dye laser and photodynamic therapy. Laser treatment burns the tiny blood vessels in warts. Over time the wart dies and falls off.\\nEvidence for how well laser treatments work is limited.\\nA carbon dioxide laser can cause pain and scarring.\"},\n",

Laser surgery can repair a retinal tear or hole. Your surgeon uses a laser to heat small pinpoints on the retina. This creates scarring that usually binds the retina to the underlying tissue. Immediate laser treatment of a new retinal tear can decrease the chance of it causing a retinal detachment.\\n- Shrinking irregular blood vessels. Your eye doctor may use a technique called scatter laser photocoagulation to shrink irregular new blood vessels that are bleeding or threatening to bleed into the eye. This treatment may help people with diabetic retinopathy. Extensive use of this treatment may cause the loss of some side (peripheral) or night vision.\\n- Freezing. In this process, called cryopexy (KRY-o-pek-see), your surgeon applies a freezing probe to the outside wall of the eye to treat a retinal tear. Intense cold reaches the inside of the eye and freezes the retina. The treated area will later scar and secure the retina to the eye wall.\\n- Injecting air or gas into your eye.

In a variation of an EEG test, you may have a high-density EEG. For this test, electrodes are placed closer together compared with a conventional EEG. High-density EEG may help more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures.\\n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can detect tumors, bleeding or cysts in the brain that might be causing epilepsy.\\n- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of the brain. Like a CT scan, an MRI looks at the structure of the brain to detect what may be causing seizures. But an MRI provides a more detailed look at the brain than a CT scan.\\n- Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of the brain are working. This test may be used before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement. This allows surgeons to avoid those areas while operating.\\n- Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material. The material is injected into a vein to help visualize metabolic activity of the brain and detect changes. Areas of the brain with low metabolism may indicate places where seizures occur.\\n- Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used if MRI and EEG didn't pinpoint the location in the brain where the seizures start.\\nA SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material. The material is injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3D map of blood flow during seizures. Areas of higher than typical blood flow may indicate areas where seizures occur.\\nAnother type of SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM) may provide even more-detailed results. The test overlaps the SPECT results with brain MRI results.\\n- Neuropsychological tests. These tests assess thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help determine which areas of the brain are affected by seizures.\\nAlong with your test results, a combination of other techniques may be used to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start:\\n- Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM looks at the areas of the brain with increased blood flow during seizures. It's compared to the same areas of the brains of people who don't have seizures. This provides information about where seizures begin.\\n- Electrical source imaging (ESI). ESI is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain. This is done to show areas where seizures are occurring. This technique provides more-precise detail than does EEG alone.\\n- Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity. This helps find the potential areas where seizures start. MEG can be more accurate than EEG because the skull and tissue surrounding the brain interfere less with magnetic fields.

These can include losing weight if needed, following good sleep habits, getting regular physical activity, cutting back on alcohol and caffeine near bedtime, and avoiding recreational drugs.\\n- Treatment of other health conditions. Treating medical and mental health conditions that may be causing or adding to sleep disorders may improve sleep.\\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). CBT-I involves looking at thoughts and behaviors that interfere with sleep. With guidance, you can create a plan for getting better rest. This may include finding ways to relax at bedtime, going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day, and not taking naps.\\n- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. This is the standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. You use a CPAP machine to treat obstructive sleep apnea whenever you're sleeping. The machine has a hose that connects to a mask. You wear the mask over your face or nose. The machine provides airflow at a pressure that holds your airway open during sleep.\\nA type of CPAP called bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) may be used in obstructive sleep apnea for people who can't tolerate CPAP. BPAP also may be used to help breathing in people who have conditions that keep their breathing muscles from working as they should.\\n- Oral appliances. Appliances worn in the mouth, known as oral appliances, may be an option instead of CPAP. These are custom-made mouthpieces that are used during sleep. The goal is to lessen airflow blockage in the throat area by pushing the lower jaw and tongue forward.\\n- Surgeries. Another option instead of CPAP is surgery. There are different surgical options designed to lessen airflow blockage during sleep. These include surgeries on the nose or jaws and surgeries to reduce upper airway soft tissue.\\nA newer surgical option for obstructive sleep apnea is upper airway nerve stimulation therapy. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has approved an upper airway nerve stimulation system called Inspire to treat obstructive sleep apnea in some people if CPAP therapy doesn't work.\\nSurgery is needed to place the Inspire system. A small device called a generator is placed under the skin on the upper chest. When the breathing muscles don't move, the device sends a pulse to the nerve under the tongue. This causes the tongue to move forward, opening the airway.\\n- Medicines. Medicines and supplements may help treat some sleep disorders.\"},\n",

But sometimes, your healthcare professional may suggest blood tests to check your levels of:\\n- Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen (estradiol). FSH goes up and estrogen goes down during menopause. Because hormones go up and down during perimenopause, it can be hard to tell from these tests whether you're in menopause.\\n- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Overactive thyroid, called hyperthyroidism, can cause symptoms like those of menopause.\\nYou can get home tests to check FSH levels in your urine without a prescription. The tests show whether you have higher FSH levels. This might mean that you're in perimenopause or menopause.\\nBut FSH levels rise and fall during your menstrual cycle. So home FSH tests can't really tell you whether you're in menopause.\",\n",

It's best used by people who are younger than 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause.\\nIf you still have your uterus, you'll need progestin with estrogen. Estrogen also helps prevent bone loss.\\nLong-term use of hormone therapy may have some heart disease and breast cancer risks. But starting hormones around the time of menopause has shown benefits for some people. Talk with your healthcare professional about whether hormone therapy may be safe for you.\\n- Vaginal estrogen. To relieve vaginal dryness, you can apply estrogen to the vagina using a vaginal cream, tablet or ring. This treatment gives you a small amount of estrogen, which the vaginal tissues take in. It can help ease vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse and some urinary symptoms.\\n- Prasterone (Intrarosa). You put this human-made hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) into the vagina. It helps ease vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse.\\n- Low-dose medicines to treat depression, called antidepressants. Some antidepressants may ease menopausal hot flashes. These are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI). A low-dose antidepressant may help manage hot flashes in people who can't take estrogen for health reasons or for those who need an antidepressant for a mood disorder.\\n- Gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin). Gabapentin is approved to treat seizures, but it also has been shown to help reduce hot flashes. This medicine is useful for people who can't use estrogen therapy and for those who also have nighttime hot flashes.\\n- Clonidine (Catapres-TTS-1, Nexiclon XR).

An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. A health care provider may inject a dye into a blood vessel to view your arteries and veins and highlight blood circulation. This type of test is called a magnetic resonance angiogram.\\nYour neurologist may recommend a perfusion MRI if available. This type of imaging can measure the amount of blood passing through the vessels. It can show the extent of reduction of blood supply to the brain.\\n- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed image of your brain.  A health care provider may inject a dye into a blood vessel to highlight blood flow in your arteries and veins. This is called a (CT angiogram). This test can't diagnose early stages of moyamoya disease. But it may be helpful in identifying problems with blood vessels.\\n- Cerebral angiogram. In a cerebral angiogram, a health care provider inserts a long, thin tube called a catheter into a blood vessel in your groin. The provider then guides it to your brain using X-ray imaging. The provider injects dye through the catheter into the blood vessels of your brain. The contrast conforms to the shape of the blood vessels to make them more visible under X-ray imaging.\\n- Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). In these tests, you're injected with a small amount of a safe radioactive material.   PET provides visual images of brain activity. SPECT measures blood flow to regions of the brain.\\n- Electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG monitors the electrical activity in your brain using small metal discs called electrodes attached to your scalp. Children with moyamoya disease often have EEG results that aren't typical.\\n- Transcranial Doppler ultrasound. In surgical transcranial Doppler ultrasound, sound waves are used to obtain images of your head and sometimes your neck. Specialists may use this test to evaluate blood flow in blood vessels in your neck.\\nIf necessary, your neurologist may order other tests to rule out other conditions.\",\n",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), may help with mild joint pain and inflammation. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Since NSAIDs can damage the liver, regular blood tests may be needed to check liver function.\\n- Steroids. Many people who have adult Still disease require treatment with steroids, such as prednisone. These powerful drugs reduce inflammation. They may lower the body's resistance to infections and increase the risk of developing osteoporosis and diabetes.\\n- Methotrexate. The medicine methotrexate (Trexall) is often used in combination with prednisone. The prednisone dose is reduced when combined with methotrexate.\\n- Biologic response modifiers. If other medicines haven't worked, your health care provider may recommend a biologic response modifier. Biologic response modifiers are medicines that block proteins causing inflammation.

Many programs address the range of social, language and behavioral difficulties associated with autism spectrum disorder. Some programs focus on reducing problem behaviors and teaching new skills. Other programs focus on teaching children how to act in social situations or communicate better with others. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) can help children learn new skills and generalize these skills to multiple situations through a reward-based motivation system.\\n- Educational therapies. Children with autism spectrum disorder often respond well to highly structured educational programs. Successful programs typically include a team of specialists and a variety of activities to improve social skills, communication and behavior. Preschool children who receive intensive, individualized behavioral interventions often show good progress.\\n- Family therapies. Parents and other family members can learn how to play and interact with their children in ways that promote social interaction skills, manage problem behaviors, and teach daily living skills and communication.\\n- Other therapies.

Also share information about members of your family who have allergies of any kind.\\n- A physical examination. A careful exam can often identify or exclude other medical problems.\\n- A skin test. A skin prick test can determine whether you may react to a particular food. In this test, a small amount of the suspected food is placed on the skin of your forearm or back. A doctor or another healthcare professional then pricks your skin to allow a tiny amount of the substance beneath your skin surface.\\nIf you're allergic to a particular substance being tested, you develop a raised bump or reaction. However, a positive reaction to this test alone isn't enough to confirm a food allergy.\\n- A blood test. A blood test can measure your immune system's response to particular foods by measuring the allergy-related antibody known as immunoglobulin E (IgE).\\nFor this test, a blood sample taken in your care professional's office is sent to a medical laboratory. It will then be tested for foods that could have caused an allergic reaction.\\n- Elimination diet. You may be asked to eliminate suspect foods for a week or two and then add the food items back into your diet one at a time. This process can help link symptoms to specific foods. However, elimination diets aren't foolproof.\\nAn elimination diet can't tell you whether your reaction to a food is a true allergy instead of a food sensitivity.

Choices include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor).\\n- Cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Your small intestine absorbs the cholesterol from your diet and releases it into your bloodstream. The drug ezetimibe (Zetia) helps reduce blood cholesterol by limiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Ezetimibe can be used with a statin drug.\\n- Bempedoic acid. This newer drug works in much the same way as statins but is less likely to cause muscle pain. Adding bempedoic acid (Nexletol) to a maximum statin dosage can help lower LDL significantly. A combination pill containing both bempedoic acid and ezetimibe (Nexlizet) also is available.\\n- Bile-acid-binding resins. Your liver uses cholesterol to make bile acids, a substance needed for digestion. The medications cholestyramine (Prevalite), colesevelam (Welchol) and colestipol (Colestid) lower cholesterol indirectly by binding to bile acids. This prompts your liver to use excess cholesterol to make more bile acids, which reduces the level of cholesterol in your blood.\\n- PCSK9 inhibitors. These drugs can help the liver absorb more LDL cholesterol, which lowers the amount of cholesterol circulating in your blood. Alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) might be used for people who have a genetic condition that causes very high levels of LDL or in people with a history of coronary disease who have intolerance to statins or other cholesterol medications.

Tests include:\\n- MRI scan. As you lie inside a large cylinder, magnetic fields and radio waves show views of your kidneys. This method most often is used to know how badly PKD affects the kidneys, liver or pancreas. MRI can help measure total kidney volume, which helps healthcare professionals know more about your condition.\\n- Ultrasound. This involves putting a wandlike device called a transducer on your body. It gives off sound waves that go back to the transducer. A computer turns the sound waves into images of your kidneys.\\n- CT scan. You lie on a table that goes into a big, doughnut-shaped device. The device uses X-ray beams to show images of your kidneys.',\n",
       "  'Treatment': \"How bad polycystic kidney disease is varies from person to person. That's true even among people in the same family. Often, people with PKD reach end-stage kidney disease between ages 55 and 65. But some people with PKD have mild disease. They might never get to end-stage kidney disease.\\nTreating polycystic kidney disease involves dealing with the following symptoms and complications in their early stages:\\n- Kidney cyst growth. The medicine tolvaptan (Jynarque, Samsca) may be used for adults at risk of ADPKD that's getting worse fast. Tolvaptan is a pill that you swallow that slows how fast kidney cysts grow. It also slows the decline in how well your kidneys work.\\nTolvaptan carries a risk of serious liver injury. And it can interact with other medicines you take. It's best to see a specialist in kidney health, called a nephrologist. A nephrologist can watch for side effects and possible complications of the medicine.\\n- High blood pressure. Keeping high blood pressure under control can slow the disease and kidney damage. Eating a low-sodium, low-fat diet that's moderate in protein and calories and drinking more fluids may help control blood pressure.\\nOther helpful lifestyle changes include not smoking, moving more and easing stress. Smoking can greatly harm the kidneys. It also can speed up the start of kidney failure.\\nMedicines most often are needed to control high blood pressure. Medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are often used to control high blood pressure.\\n- Loss of kidney function. To help your kidneys stay as healthy as possible for as long as possible, experts suggest being at a healthy weight and body mass index. Drinking water and fluids throughout the day may help slow the growth of kidney cysts. This could slow the loss of kidney function. Eating a low-salt diet with less protein might let kidney cysts respond better to more fluids.\\n- Pain. You might be able to control the pain of polycystic kidney disease with medicines available without a prescription, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Don't take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines can affect how your kidneys work.\\nFor worse pain, a healthcare professional might use a needle to draw out cyst fluid and put in a medicine to shrink kidney cysts. The medicine is called a sclerosing agent.\\nOr you may need surgery to remove cysts if they're large enough to cause pressure and pain. The surgery is called cyst fenestration.\\n- Bladder or kidney infections. Treating infections quickly with antibiotics can help prevent kidney damage. You might have a simple bladder infection or a more complicated cyst or kidney infection. For more-complicated infections, you may need to take antibiotics longer.\\n- Blood in the urine. Drink lots of fluids as soon as you notice blood in your urine. It's best to drink water to dilute the urine. This might help prevent clots from forming in your urinary tract.\\nMost often, the bleeding stops on its own. If it doesn't, call your healthcare professional.\\n- Kidney failure. Your kidneys can stop removing waste and extra fluids from your blood. Then you need either dialysis or a kidney transplant. That's why you need to see your healthcare team regularly.\\nYou may be able to have a kidney transplant before your kidneys fail. Then you wouldn't need to have dialysis. This is called preemptive kidney transplantation.\\n- Aneurysms. If you have polycystic kidney disease and a family history of brain aneurysms that burst, your healthcare team may want to do regular screenings for brain aneurysms.\\nIf you have an aneurysm, surgical clipping might reduce the risk of bleeding. This depends on the size of the aneurysm. Nonsurgical treatment of small aneurysms may involve controlling high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, as well as quitting smoking.\\nEarly treatment offers the best chance of slowing the progress of polycystic kidney disease.\"},\n",

A random blood sugar level of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or higher suggests diabetes.\\n- Fasting blood sugar test. A blood sample is taken after your child hasn't had anything to eat or drink but water for at least eight hours or overnight (fasting). A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher suggests diabetes.\\n- Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test. This test indicates your child's average blood sugar level for the past 3 months. An A1C level of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes.\\n- Oral glucose tolerance test. Your child will need to fast overnight and then drink a sugary liquid at the health care provider's office or a laboratory testing site. Blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher generally means your child has diabetes.\",\n",

The goal of treatment is to keep your child's blood sugar within a certain range. This target range helps to keep your child's blood sugar level as close to the standard range as possible.\\nYour child's health care provider will let you know what your child's blood sugar target range is, and may also set an A1C target. These numbers may change as your child grows and changes and so will your child's diabetes treatment plan.\"},\n",

Your doctor might order blood tests to determine the number of red cells, white cells and platelets and look for unusual changes in the size, shape and appearance of various blood cells.\\n- Removing bone marrow for testing. During a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, a thin needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) a small amount of liquid bone marrow, usually from a spot on the back of your hipbone. Then a small piece of bone with its marrow is removed (biopsy).\\nBlood and bone marrow samples are sent for laboratory analysis.

Imaging tests used to diagnose pancreatic cancer include ultrasound, CT scans, MRI scans and, sometimes, positron emission tomography scans, also called PET scans.\\n- A scope with ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound, also called EUS, is a test to make pictures of the digestive tract and nearby organs and tissues. EUS uses a long, thin tube with a camera, called an endoscope. The endoscope passes down the throat and into the stomach. An ultrasound device on the endoscope uses sound waves to create images of nearby tissues. It can be used to make pictures of the pancreas.\\n- Removing a tissue sample for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for testing in a lab. Most often, a health professional gets the sample during EUS. During EUS, special tools are passed through the endoscope to take some tissue from the pancreas. Less often, a sample of tissue is collected from the pancreas by inserting a needle through the skin and into the pancreas. This is called fine-needle aspiration.\\nThe sample goes to the lab for testing to see if its cancer. Other specialized tests can show what DNA changes are present in the cancer cells. The results help your health care team create your treatment plan.\\n- Blood tests. Blood tests might show proteins called tumor markers that pancreatic cancer cells make. One tumor marker test used in pancreatic cancer is called CA19-9. Doctors often repeat this test during and after treatment to understand how the cancer is responding. Some pancreatic cancers don't make extra CA19-9, so this test isn't helpful for everyone.\\n- Genetic testing. If you're diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, talk with your health care team about genetic testing. Genetic testing uses a sample of blood or saliva to look for inherited DNA changes that increase the risk of cancer. Results of genetic testing might help guide your treatment. The results also can show whether family members might have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

       " {'Diagnosis': \"If your health care provider thinks you might have a brain tumor, you'll need a number of tests and procedures to be sure. These might include:\\n- A neurological exam. A neurological exam tests different parts of your brain to see how they're working. This exam may include checking your vision, hearing, balance, coordination, strength and reflexes. If you have trouble in one or more areas, this is a clue for your health care provider. A neurological exam doesn't detect a brain tumor. But it helps your provider understand what part of your brain might be having a problem.\\n- Head CT scan. A computed tomography scan, also called a CT scan, uses X-rays to make pictures. It's widely available, and results come back quickly. So CT might be the first imaging test that's done if you have headaches or other symptoms that have many possible causes. A CT scan can detect problems in and around your brain. The results give your health care provider clues to decide what test to do next. If your provider thinks your CT scan shows a brain tumor, you might need a brain MRI.\\n- Brain MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging, also called MRI, uses strong magnets to create pictures of the inside of the body. MRI is often used to detect brain tumors because it shows the brain more clearly than do other imaging tests.\\nOften a dye is injected into a vein in the arm before an MRI. The dye makes clearer pictures. This makes it easier to see smaller tumors. It can help your health care team see the difference between a brain tumor and healthy brain tissue.\\nSometimes you need a special type of MRI to create more-detailed pictures. One example is functional MRI. This special MRI shows which parts of the brain control speaking, moving and other important tasks. This helps your health care provider plan surgery and other treatments.\\nAnother special MRI test is magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This test uses MRI to measure levels of certain chemicals in the tumor cells. Having too much or too little of the chemicals might tell your health care team about the kind of brain tumor you have.\\nMagnetic resonance perfusion is another special type of MRI. This test uses MRI to measure the amount of blood in different parts of the brain tumor. The parts of the tumor that have a higher amount of blood may be the most active parts of the tumor. Your health care team uses this information to plan your treatment.\\n- PET scan of the brain. A positron emission tomography scan, also called a PET scan, can detect some brain tumors. A PET scan uses a radioactive tracer that's injected into a vein. The tracer travels through the blood and attaches to brain tumor cells. The tracer makes the tumor cells stand out on the pictures taken by the PET machine. Cells that are dividing and multiplying quickly will take up more of the tracer.\\nA PET scan may be most helpful for detecting brain tumors that are growing quickly. Examples include glioblastomas and some oligodendrogliomas. Brain tumors that grow slowly might not be detected on a PET scan. Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to grow more slowly, so PET scans are less useful for benign brain tumors. Not everyone with a brain tumor needs a PET scan. Ask your health care provider whether you need at PET scan.\\n- Collecting a sample of tissue. A brain biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of brain tumor tissue for testing in a lab. Often a surgeon gets the sample during surgery to remove the brain tumor.\\n    \\nIf surgery isn't possible, a sample might be removed with a needle. Removing a sample of brain tumor tissue with a needle is done with a procedure called stereotactic needle biopsy.\\nDuring this procedure, a small hole is drilled in the skull. A thin needle is inserted through the hole. The needle is used to take a tissue sample. Imaging tests such as CT and MRI are used to plan the path of the needle. You won't feel anything during the biopsy because medicine is used to numb the area. Often you also receive medicine that puts you in a sleep-like state so you're not aware.\\nYou might have a needle biopsy rather than surgery if your health care team is worried that an operation might hurt an important part of your brain. A needle might be needed to remove tissue from a brain tumor if the tumor is in a spot that's hard to reach with surgery.\\nBrain biopsy has a risk of complications. Risks include bleeding in the brain and damage to the brain tissue.\\n- Testing the tissue sample in the lab. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing. Tests can see whether the cells are cancerous or not cancerous. The way the cells look under a microscope can tell your health care team how quickly the cells are growing. This is called the brain tumor's grade. Other tests can find out what DNA changes are present in the cells. This helps your health care team create your treatment plan.\",\n",

Treatment options also depend on the type, size, grade and location of the brain tumor. Options might include surgery, radiation therapy, radiosurgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. When considering your treatment options, your health care team also considers your overall health and your preferences.\\nTreatment might not be needed right away. You might not need treatment right away if your brain tumor is small, isn't cancerous and doesn't cause symptoms. Small, benign brain tumors might not grow or might grow so slowly that they won't ever cause problems. You might have brain MRI scans a few times a year to check for brain tumor growth.

Your health care provider can look at all your medicines — pills, injections, creams and inhalers — to see if you're taking medicines that can cause the syndrome. If you are, you won't need other tests.\\nWhen Cushing syndrome is caused by the body making too much cortisol, it can be hard to diagnose. That's because other illnesses have similar symptoms. Diagnosing Cushing syndrome can be a long and complex process. You'll need to see a doctor who specializes in hormonal diseases, called an endocrinologist.\\nThe endocrinologist likely will do a physical exam and look for signs of Cushing syndrome, such as a round face, a hump on the back of the neck, and thin, bruised skin with stretch marks.\\nIf you haven't been using a glucocorticoid medicine, these tests may help pinpoint the cause of Cushing syndrome:\\n- Urine and blood tests. These tests measure hormone levels and show if the body is making too much cortisol. For the urine test, you may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. Cortisol, ACTH and other hormones are be measured in urine and blood samples.\\nYour health care provider also might recommend other tests. These tests measure cortisol levels before and after using hormone medicines to trigger or block cortisol.\\n- Saliva test. Cortisol levels typically rise and fall during the day. In people without Cushing syndrome, cortisol drops in the evening. By looking at cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected at night, the health care team can see if cortisol levels are too high.\\n- Imaging tests. CT or MRI scans can take pictures of the pituitary and adrenal glands to see if anything shows up, such as tumors.\\n- Inferior petrosal sinus sampling. This test can help decide if Cushing syndrome is caused by an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma, or ACTH-producing tumor in another organ. For the test, blood samples are taken from the veins that drain the pituitary gland, called the inferior petrosal sinuses.\\nDuring the test, you are given medicine through a vein to help you stay calm and comfortable. A thin tube is placed in your groin or neck area and is threaded to the inferior petrosal sinuses to collect a blood sample. Another blood sample is taken from your forearm. You are then given a medicine that causes the tumor to make more ACTH, and blood samples are taken again from the same areas. Levels of ACTH are then compared between the two sample areas.\\nIf the ACTH level is higher in the sinus sample, the problem is coming from the pituitary. If the ACTH levels are similar between the sinuses and forearm, the problem is outside of the pituitary gland.\\nThese tests help your health care provider diagnose Cushing syndrome. They also may help rule out other health conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome — a hormone problem in people with enlarged ovaries. Depression, eating disorders and alcoholism also can have symptoms similar to Cushing syndrome.\",\n",

You will need further treatment to keep the disease from coming back.\\n- Consolidation therapy. This phase also is called post-remission therapy or maintenance therapy. It aims to kill the remaining leukemia cells. Consolidation therapy is crucial to helping lower the risk of relapse.\\nTreatments include:\\nChemotherapy. Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. Most chemotherapy medicines are given through a vein. Some come in pill form. Chemotherapy is the main type of remission induction therapy. It also may be used for consolidation therapy.\\nPeople with AML usually stay in the hospital during chemotherapy treatments because the medicines kill many healthy blood cells while destroying leukemia cells.

Serious, long-term complications may include heart disease, lung damage, fertility problems and other cancers.\\nTargeted therapy. Targeted therapy for cancer is a treatment that uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy may be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy during induction therapy.\\nBone marrow transplant.

In some cases, it may cause potentially serious low sodium levels in the blood. Talk to your health care provider about how and when to adjust your dosage of desmopressin.\\n- Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Because the kidneys don't properly respond to ADH in this form of diabetes insipidus, desmopressin won't help. Instead, your health care provider may advise you to eat a low-salt diet to lower the amount of urine your kidneys make.\\nTreatment with hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide) may ease your symptoms.

The provider may also ask about your risk factors, such as past exposure to radiation and a family history of thyroid cancers.\\n- Thyroid function blood tests. Tests that measure blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and hormones produced by your thyroid gland might give your health care team clues about the health of your thyroid.\\n- Ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create pictures of body structures. To create an image of the thyroid, the ultrasound transducer is placed on your lower neck.\\nThe way a thyroid nodule looks on an ultrasound image helps your provider determine if it's likely to be cancer. Signs that a thyroid nodule is more likely to be cancerous include calcium deposits (microcalcifications) within the nodule and an irregular border around the nodule. If there's a high likelihood that a nodule might be cancerous, additional tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine what type of thyroid cancer is present.\\nYour provider may also use ultrasound to create images of the lymph nodes in the neck (lymph node mapping) to look for signs of cancer.\\n- Removing a sample of thyroid tissue. During a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, your provider inserts a long, thin needle through your skin and into the thyroid nodule. Ultrasound imaging is typically used to precisely guide the needle. Your provider uses the needle to remove some cells from the thyroid. The sample is sent to a lab for analysis.\\nIn the lab, a doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and body tissue (pathologist) examines the tissue sample under a microscope and determines whether cancer is present. The results aren't always clear. Some types of thyroid cancer, particularly follicular thyroid cancer and Hurthle cell thyroid cancer, are more likely to have uncertain results (indeterminate thyroid nodules). Your provider may recommend another biopsy procedure or an operation to remove the thyroid nodule for testing. Specialized tests of the cells to look for gene changes (molecular marker testing) also can be helpful.\\n- An imaging test that uses a radioactive tracer. A radioactive iodine scan uses a radioactive form of iodine and a special camera to detect thyroid cancer cells in your body. It's most often used after surgery to find any cancer cells that might remain. This test is most helpful for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers.\\nHealthy thyroid cells absorb and use iodine from the blood. Some types of thyroid cancer cells do this, too. When the radioactive iodine is injected in a vein or swallowed, any thyroid cancer cells in the body will take up the iodine. Any cells that take up the iodine are shown on the radioactive iodine scan images.\\n- Other imaging tests. You may have one or more imaging tests to help your provider determine whether your cancer has spread beyond the thyroid. Imaging tests may include ultrasound, CT and MRI.\\n- Genetic testing. A portion of medullary thyroid cancers are caused by inherited genes that are passed from parents to children. If you're diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer, your provider may recommend meeting with a genetic counselor to consider genetic testing.

Your healthcare professional performs a physical exam and a neurological exam. Tests of your vision, eye movements, speech and language, strength, reflexes, and sensory system are included.\\nYour healthcare professional may use a stethoscope to listen to the carotid artery in your neck. During this exam, a whooshing sound called a bruit may mean that you have atherosclerosis. Or your healthcare professional may use an ophthalmoscope. This instrument looks for cholesterol fragments or platelet fragments called emboli in the tiny blood vessels of the retina at the back of the eye.\\nYou also may be checked for risk factors of a stroke. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes and sometimes high levels of the amino acid homocysteine.\\n- Carotid ultrasonography. If your healthcare professional suspects that a narrowed carotid artery in the neck may be the cause of your TIA, you may need a carotid ultrasound. A wandlike device called a transducer sends high-frequency sound waves into the neck. The sound waves pass through the tissue and create images on a screen. The images can show narrowing or clotting in the carotid arteries.\\n- Computerized tomography (CT) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA) scans. CT scans of the head use X-ray beams to create a 3D image. This allows your healthcare professional to look at the brain or the arteries in the neck and brain. A CTA scan may involve an injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel. Unlike a carotid ultrasound, a CTA scan can look at blood vessels in the neck and head.\\n- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). These tests use a strong magnetic field to create a 3D view of the brain. MRA uses technology similar to MRI to look at the arteries in the neck and brain. But an MRA may include an injection of a contrast material into a blood vessel.\\n- Echocardiography. This test may be done to find out if a heart issue caused fragments in the blood that led to a blockage. A traditional echocardiography is called a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A TTE involves moving an instrument called a transducer across the chest to look at the heart. The transducer emits sound waves that bounce off different parts of the heart, creating an ultrasound image.\\nOr you may need another type of echocardiography called a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). A flexible probe with a transducer is placed into the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, known as the esophagus. Because the esophagus is directly behind the heart, a TEE can create clearer, detailed ultrasound images. This allows a better view of some things, such as blood clots, that might not be seen clearly in a traditional echocardiography exam.\\n- Arteriography. This procedure is used in some people to get a view of arteries in the brain not usually seen in an X-ray. A radiologist inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a small incision, usually in the groin.\\nThe catheter is guided through the major arteries and into the carotid or vertebral artery in the neck.

In this type of treatment, chemotherapy drugs are often injected directly into the fluid that covers the spinal cord.\\nDepending on your situation, the phases of treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia can span two to three years.\\nTreatments may include:\\n- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, which uses drugs to kill cancer cells, is typically used as an induction therapy for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Chemotherapy drugs can also be used in the consolidation and maintenance phases.\\n- Targeted therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your leukemia cells will be tested to see if targeted therapy may be helpful for you. Targeted therapy can be used alone or in combination with chemotherapy for induction therapy, consolidation therapy or maintenance therapy.\\n- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. If the cancer cells have spread to the central nervous system, your doctor may recommend radiation therapy.\\n- Bone marrow transplant. A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, may be used as consolidation therapy or for treating relapse if it occurs. This procedure allows someone with leukemia to reestablish healthy bone marrow by replacing leukemic bone marrow with leukemia-free marrow from a healthy person.\\nA bone marrow transplant begins with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any leukemia-producing bone marrow. The marrow is then replaced by bone marrow from a compatible donor (allogeneic transplant).\\n- Engineering immune cells to fight leukemia.

A bacterium called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori can cause stomach problems. H. pylori testing may involve a stool sample, the breath or tissue samples of the stomach taken during endoscopy.\\n- Endoscopy.

Depending on the results of the blood tests, you may need other tests too.\\n- Medical history and physical exam. During the exam, your health care provider may check for:\\n\\nSlight tremor in your fingers and hands.\\nOveractive reflexes.\\nRapid or irregular pulse.\\nEye changes.\\nWarm, moist skin.\\nYour provider also examines your thyroid gland as you swallow to see if it's larger than usual, bumpy or tender.\\n- Slight tremor in your fingers and hands.\\n- Overactive reflexes.\\n- Rapid or irregular pulse.\\n- Eye changes.\\n- Warm, moist skin.\\n- Blood tests. Blood tests that measure the hormones T-4 and T-3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) can confirm a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. A high level of T-4 and a low level of TSH is common in people with hyperthyroidism.\\nBlood tests are particularly important for older adults because they may not have classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\\nThyroid blood tests may give false results if you take biotin. Biotin is a B vitamin supplement that also may be found in multivitamins. Tell your health care provider if you are taking biotin or a multivitamin with biotin. To make sure your blood test is accurate, your health care provider may ask you to stop taking biotin 3 to 5 days before the test.\\nIf blood test results show hyperthyroidism, your health care provider may suggest one of the following tests. They can help find out why your thyroid is overactive.\\n- Radioiodine scan and uptake test. For this test, you take a small, dose of radioactive iodine, called radioiodine, to see how much of it collects in your thyroid gland and where it collects in the gland.\\nIf your thyroid gland takes in a high amount of radioiodine, that means your thyroid gland is making too much thyroid hormone. The most likely cause is either Graves' disease or overactive thyroid nodules.\\nIf your thyroid gland takes in a low amount of radioiodine, that means hormones stored in the thyroid gland are leaking into the bloodstream. In that case, it's likely that you have thyroiditis.\\n- Thyroid ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the thyroid. Ultrasound may be better at finding thyroid nodules than are other tests. There's no exposure to radiation with this test, so it can be used for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or others who can't take radioiodine.\",\n",
       "  'Treatment': \"There are several treatments available for hyperthyroidism. The best approach for you depends on your age and health. The underlying cause of hyperthyroidism and how severe it is make a difference too. Your personal preference also should be considered as you and your health care provider decide on a treatment plan. Treatment may include:\\n- Anti-thyroid medicine. These medications slowly ease symptoms of hyperthyroidism by preventing the thyroid gland from making too many hormones. Anti-thyroid medications include methimazole and propylthiouracil. Symptoms usually begin to improve within several weeks to months.\\nTreatment with anti-thyroid medicine typically lasts 12 to 18 months. After that, the dose may be slowly decreased or stopped if symptoms go away and if blood test results show that thyroid hormone levels have returned to the standard range. For some people, anti-thyroid medicine puts hyperthyroidism into long-term remission. But other people may find that hyperthyroidism comes back after this treatment.\\nAlthough rare, serious liver damage can happen with both anti-thyroid medications. But because propylthiouracil has caused many more cases of liver damage, it's generally used only when people can't take methimazole. A small number of people who are allergic to these medicines may develop skin rashes, hives, fever or joint pain. They also can raise the risk of infection.\\n- Beta blockers. These medicines don't affect thyroid hormone levels. But they can lessen symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as a tremor, rapid heart rate and heart palpitations. Sometimes, health care providers prescribe them to ease symptoms until thyroid hormones are closer to a standard level. These medicines generally aren't recommended for people who have asthma. Side effects may include fatigue and sexual problems.\\n- Radioiodine therapy. The thyroid gland takes up radioiodine. This treatment causes the gland to shrink. This medicine is taken by mouth. With this treatment, symptoms typically lessen within several months. This treatment usually causes thyroid activity to slow enough to make the thyroid gland underactive. That condition is hypothyroidism. Because of that, over time, you may need to take medicine to replace thyroid hormones.\\n- Thyroidectomy. This is surgery to remove part of or all of the thyroid gland. It is not used often to treat hyperthyroidism. But it may be an option for people who are pregnant. It also may be a choice for those who can't take anti-thyroid medicine and don't want to or can't take radioiodine therapy.\\nRisks of this surgery include damage to the vocal cords and parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands on the back of the thyroid. They help control the level of calcium in the blood.\\nPeople who have a thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy need lifelong treatment with the medicine levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid, others). It supplies the body with thyroid hormones. If the parathyroid glands are removed during surgery, medicine also is needed to keep blood calcium in a healthy range.\"},\n",

A second medicine, azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), may be recommended in addition to prednisone.\\nPrednisone, especially when taken long term, can cause a wide range of serious side effects, including diabetes, weakened or broken bones, high blood pressure, cataracts, glaucoma, and weight gain.\\nHealthcare professionals typically prescribe prednisone at a high dose for about the first month of treatment. Then, to reduce the risk of side effects, they gradually reduce the dose over the next several months until reaching the lowest possible dose that controls the disease. Adding azathioprine also helps you avoid prednisone side effects.\\nAlthough you may experience remission a few years after starting treatment, the disease often returns if the drug is discontinued.

      "Your health care provider likely will start by asking questions about your symptoms. You'll also get a physical exam. This exam is likely to include:\n",
      "- Digital rectal exam. The provider inserts a finger into your rectum to check if your prostate is enlarged.\n",
      "- Urine test. A lab checks a sample of your urine to find out if you have an illness or other problems that can cause the same symptoms as those of BPH.\n",
      "- Blood test. The results can show if you have kidney problems.\n",
      "After that, you might need other tests that can help confirm an enlarged prostate. These tests include:\n",
      "- Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. PSA is a protein made in the prostate. PSA levels go up when the prostate becomes enlarged. But higher PSA levels also can be due to recent procedures, illnesses, surgery or prostate cancer.\n",
      "- Urinary flow test. You pee into a container attached to a machine. The machine measures how strong your urine flow is and how much urine you pass. Test results can show over time whether your condition is getting better or worse.\n",
      "- Postvoid residual volume test. This test measures whether you can empty your bladder fully. The test can be done using an imaging exam called ultrasound. Or it can be done with a tube called a catheter placed into your bladder after you pee to measure how much urine is left in the bladder.\n",
      "- 24-hour voiding diary. This involves noting how often and how much you pee. It might be extra helpful if you make more than a third of your daily urine at night.\n",
      "If your health problem is more complex, you may need tests including:\n",
      "- Transrectal ultrasound. A device that uses sound waves to make pictures is inserted into the rectum. It measures the size of the prostate.\n",
      "- Prostate biopsy. This test uses ultrasound imaging to guide needles that take tissue samples of the prostate. Checking the prostate tissue can help your doctor find out if you have prostate cancer.\n",
      "- Urodynamic and pressure flow studies. A catheter is threaded through the urethra into the bladder. Water — or, less often, air — is slowly sent into the bladder to measure bladder pressure and check how well the bladder muscles work when you try to pass urine.\n",
      "- Cystoscopy. A lighted, flexible tool is placed into the urethra. It lets a provider see inside the urethra and bladder. Before this test, you may be given a topical medicine that numbs the urethra.\n",

      "- Blood tests. These can check the level of the pregnancy hormone, called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in your blood. This level is often repeated after 48 hours. A low or falling level of hCG could be a sign of pregnancy loss. If the pattern of changes in your hCG level is irregular, your health care professional may recommend more blood tests or an ultrasound. Your blood type also might be checked. If your blood type is Rh negative, a medicine called Rh immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) will likely be recommended unless you are less than six weeks pregnant.\n",
      "- Pelvic exam. Your health care professional might check to see if the lower end of your uterus, called the cervix, has begun to open. If it has, that makes a miscarriage more likely.\n",
      "- Ultrasound. During this imagining test, your health care professional checks for a fetal heartbeat and figures out if the pregnancy is growing properly. If the result of the test isn't clear, you might need to have another ultrasound in about a week.\n",
      "- Tissue tests. If you've passed what looks like tissue, it can be sent to a lab to confirm that a miscarriage has happened — and that your symptoms aren't tied to another cause.\n",
      "- Chromosomal tests. If you've had two or more previous miscarriages, your health care professional may recommend blood tests for both you and your partner. The tests can help find out if your or your partner's chromosome make-up might be linked with increased risk for miscarriage.\n",
      "If your test results show that you had a miscarriage or are at risk of having one, your health care professional might use one of the following medical terms to describe what happened:\n",
      "- Threatened miscarriage.  This means that you have bleeding from the vagina, but your cervix hasn't begun to open. So there is a threat of a miscarriage. Such pregnancies typically go on without any more problems.\n",
      "- Inevitable miscarriage.  This describes a miscarriage that can't be avoided because you're bleeding, cramping and your cervix is open.\n",
      "- Incomplete miscarriage.  This is when you pass pregnancy tissue but some remains in your uterus.\n",
      "- Missed miscarriage.  The placental and embryonic tissues remain in the uterus, but the embryo has died or was never formed.\n",
      "- Complete miscarriage.  This means you have passed all the pregnancy tissues. This is common for miscarriages that happen before 12 weeks.\n",
      "- Septic miscarriage.  This condition happens when you get an infection in your uterus after a miscarriage. This can be a life-threatening infection. You need medical care right away.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Many infertile couples have more than one cause of infertility, so it's likely you will both need to see a doctor. It might take a number of tests to determine the cause of infertility. In some cases, a cause is never identified.\n",
      "Infertility tests can be expensive and might not be covered by insurance — find out what your medical plan covers ahead of time.\n",
      "Diagnosing male infertility problems usually involves:\n",
      "- General physical examination and medical history. This includes examining your genitals and asking questions about any inherited conditions, chronic health problems, illnesses, injuries or surgeries that could affect fertility. Your doctor might also ask about your sexual habits and about your sexual development during puberty.\n",
      "- Semen analysis. Semen samples can be obtained in a couple of different ways. You can provide a sample by masturbating and ejaculating into a special container at the doctor's office. Because of religious or cultural beliefs, some men prefer an alternative method of semen collection. In such cases, semen can be collected by using a special condom during intercourse.\n",
      "Your semen is then sent to a laboratory to measure the number of sperm present and look for any abnormalities in the shape (morphology) and movement (motility) of the sperm. The lab will also check your semen for signs of problems such as infections.\n",
      "Often sperm counts fluctuate significantly from one specimen to the next. In most cases, several semen analysis tests are done over a period of time to ensure accurate results. If your sperm analysis is normal, your doctor will likely recommend thorough testing of your female partner before conducting any more male infertility tests.\n",
      "Your doctor might recommend additional tests to help identify the cause of your infertility. These can include:\n",
      "- Scrotal ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images inside your body. A scrotal ultrasound can help your doctor see if there is a varicocele or other problems in the testicles and supporting structures.\n",
      "- Transrectal ultrasound. A small, lubricated wand is inserted into your rectum. It allows your doctor to check your prostate and look for blockages of the tubes that carry semen.\n",
      "- Hormone testing. Hormones produced by the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and testicles play a key role in sexual development and sperm production. Abnormalities in other hormonal or organ systems might also contribute to infertility. A blood test measures the level of testosterone and other hormones.\n",
      "- Post-ejaculation urinalysis. Sperm in your urine can indicate your sperm are traveling backward into the bladder instead of out your penis during ejaculation (retrograde ejaculation).\n",
      "- Genetic tests. When sperm concentration is extremely low, there could be a genetic cause. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome — signs of a genetic abnormality. Genetic testing might be ordered to diagnose various congenital or inherited syndromes.\n",
      "- Testicular biopsy. This test involves removing samples from the testicle with a needle. If the results of the testicular biopsy show that sperm production is normal your problem is likely caused by a blockage or another problem with sperm transport.\n",
      "- Specialized sperm function tests. A number of tests can be used to check how well your sperm survive after ejaculation, how well they can penetrate an egg, and whether there's any problem attaching to the egg. These tests aren't often used and usually don't significantly change recommendations for treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Often, an exact cause of infertility can't be found. Even if an exact cause isn't clear, your doctor might be able to recommend treatments or procedures that will lead to conception.\n",
      "In cases of infertility, it's recommended that the female partner also be checked. There may be specific treatments recommended for your partner. Or, you may learn that proceeding with assisted reproductive techniques is appropriate in your situation.\n",
      "Treatments for male infertility include:\n",
      "- Surgery. For example, a varicocele can often be surgically corrected or an obstructed vas deferens repaired. Prior vasectomies can be reversed. In cases where no sperm are present in the ejaculate, sperm can often be retrieved directly from the testicles or epididymis using sperm retrieval techniques.\n",
      "- Treating infections. Antibiotic treatment might cure an infection of the reproductive tract, but doesn't always restore fertility.\n",
      "- Treatments for sexual intercourse problems. Medication or counseling can help improve fertility in conditions such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.\n",
      "- Hormone treatments and medications. Your doctor might recommend hormone replacement or medications in cases where infertility is caused by high or low levels of certain hormones or problems with the way the body uses hormones.\n",
      "- Assisted reproductive technology (ART). ART treatments involve obtaining sperm through normal ejaculation, surgical extraction or from donor individuals, depending on your specific case and wishes. The sperm are then inserted into the female genital tract, or used to perform in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.\n",

      "- Vagal maneuvers. Simple but specific actions such as coughing, bearing down as if passing stool or putting an ice pack on the face can help slow down the heart rate. These actions affect the vagus nerve, which helps control the heartbeat.\n",
      "- Medicines. If SVT happens frequently, medicines may be given to control the heart rate or reset the heart rhythm. It's very important to take the medicine exactly as directed in order to reduce complications.\n",
      "- Cardioversion. Paddles or patches on the chest deliver shocks that reset the heart rhythm. This treatment is generally used when emergency care is needed or when vagal maneuvers and medicines don't work. It's also possible to do cardioversion with medicines.\n",
      "- Catheter ablation. In this treatment, a doctor inserts one or more thin, flexible tubes called catheters through a blood vessel, usually in the groin. Sensors on the tip of the catheter use heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart. The scars block faulty heart signals that cause the irregular heartbeat.\n",
      "- Pacemaker. Rarely, a small device called a pacemaker is needed to help the heart to beat. It stimulates the heart as needed to keep it beating regularly. A pacemaker is placed under the skin near the collarbone in a minor surgery. Wires connect the device to the heart.\n",

      "To diagnose a meningioma, a neurologist conducts a thorough neurological exam followed by an imaging test with contrast dye, such as:\n",
      "- CT scan. CT scans take X-rays that make cross-sectional images of a full picture of the brain. Sometimes an iodine-based dye is used to make the picture easier to read.\n",

      "- Therapy. Physical therapy or exercises can strengthen the muscles in the affected area to ease pain and prevent recurrence.\n",

But proof of a prior infection can be gathered from an antibody test if a child had COVID-19 but didn't have any symptoms. It also can be collected by noting infections among a child's close contacts. Most kids who get MIS-C have a link to the virus that causes COVID-19 within 2 months of getting sick.\n",

      "- Fluids, if levels are too low, a condition called dehydration.\n",
      "- Oxygen to help with breathing.\n",
      "- Blood pressure medicines to treat low blood pressure related to shock or to help with heart function.\n",
      "- A breathing machine called a ventilator.\n",

Depending on the size of the cyst and whether it's filled with fluid or solid, your health care provider likely will recommend tests to determine its type and whether you need treatment.\n",
      "Possible tests include:\n",
      "- Pregnancy test. A positive test might suggest an early pregnancy. Corpus luteum cysts are normal to see during pregnancy.\n",
      "- Pelvic ultrasound. A wandlike device (transducer) sends and receives high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your uterus and ovaries on a video screen (ultrasound). The image is used to confirm that you have a cyst, see its location, and determine whether it's solid or filled with fluid.\n",
      "- Laparoscopy. A slim, lighted instrument (laparoscope) is inserted into your abdomen through a small cut (incision). Using the laparoscope, your provider can see your ovaries and any cyst. If a cyst is found, treatment is usually done during the same procedure. This is a surgical procedure that requires anesthesia.\n",
      "- Tumor marker tests. Blood levels of a protein called a cancer antigen often are elevated in ovarian cancer. If your cyst appears solid and you're at high risk of ovarian cancer, your provider might order a cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) test or other blood tests. CA 125 levels can also be elevated in noncancerous conditions, such as endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease.\n",
      "Sometimes, less common types of cysts develop that a health care provider finds during a pelvic exam. Solid ovarian cysts that develop after menopause might be cancerous (malignant). That's why it's important to have regular pelvic exams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment depends on your age and the type and size of your cyst. It also depends on your symptoms. Your health care provider might suggest:\n",
      "- Watchful waiting. In many cases you can wait and be reexamined to see if the cyst goes away after a few months. This is typically an option — regardless of your age — if you have no symptoms and an ultrasound shows you have a small, fluid-filled cyst. You may have several follow-up pelvic ultrasounds to see if your cyst changes in size or appearance.\n",
      "- Medicine. Hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, keep you from ovulating. This may keep you from getting more ovarian cysts. But, birth control pills won't shrink an existing cyst.\n",
      "- Surgery. Your provider might suggest removing a cyst that is large, doesn't look like a functional cyst, is growing or causes pain. Some cysts can be removed without removing the ovary (cystectomy). In some cases, the ovary with the cyst is removed (oophorectomy).\n",
      "Surgery can often be done using minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy) with a laparoscope and instruments inserted through small cuts in your abdomen. If the cyst is large or cancer is a concern, an open procedure using a larger cut may be needed.\n",
      "An ovarian cyst that develops after menopause is sometimes cancer. In this case, you may need to see a gynecologic cancer specialist. You might need surgery to remove your uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries. You may also need chemotherapy or radiation.\n",

      "- You have a strong, often irresistible urge to move the legs. This usually occurs with uncomfortable feelings in the legs.\n",
      "- Your symptoms start or get worse when you're resting, such as sitting or lying down.\n",
      "- Your symptoms are partially or temporarily relieved by activity, such as walking or stretching.\n",
      "- Your symptoms are worse at night.\n",
      "- Symptoms can't be explained solely by another medical or behavioral condition.\n",
      "Your healthcare professional may conduct a physical and a neurological exam. Blood tests, particularly for iron deficiency, may be ordered to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.\n",
      "You may be referred to a sleep specialist. This may involve an overnight stay and a study at a sleep clinic if another sleep condition such as sleep apnea is suspected. However, a diagnosis of RLS usually doesn't require a sleep study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Symptoms of restless legs syndrome sometimes go away after treating an underlying condition, such as iron deficiency. Correcting an iron deficiency may involve taking an iron supplement by mouth. Or you may be given an iron supplement through a vein in your arm. Take iron supplements only with medical supervision and after having your blood-iron level checked.\n",

      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment of bullous pemphigoid is aimed at healing the skin, relieving itching and pain, and preventing new blisters. Your healthcare professional will likely prescribe one or a combination of medicines:\n",
      "- Corticosteroids. The main treatment for bullous pemphigoid is corticosteroid medicine applied to the affected area. Usually a strong steroid cream such as clobetasol propionate is used. Long-term use this type of medicine comes with the risk of skin thinning and easy bruising. Your healthcare professional might also suggest a steroid medicine taken by mouth. Oral steroids come with the risk of harmful side effects, such as weak bones, diabetes, stomach ulcers and eye problems.\n",
      "- Antibiotics. The oral medicines dapsone and doxycycline help control blisters.\n",
      "- Medicines that target the immune system. Some medicines can stop your immune system from attacking healthy tissues. Examples are azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), rituximab (Rituxan), mycophenolate (CellCept) and methotrexate (Trexall). These medicines also have a risk of harmful side effects, including infection. People who take these medicines need close follow-up and, at times, repeat blood tests to monitor for side effects.\n",

      "Your doctor may ask your partner some questions about when and how you snore to help assess the severity of the problem. If your child snores, you'll be asked about the severity of your child's snoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "To treat your snoring, your doctor likely will first recommend lifestyle changes, such as:\n",
      "- Losing weight\n",
      "- Avoiding alcohol close to bedtime\n",
      "- Treating nasal congestion\n",
      "- Avoiding sleep deprivation\n",
      "- Avoiding sleeping on your back\n",
      "For snoring accompanied by OSA, your doctor may suggest:\n",
      "- Oral appliances. Oral appliances are form-fitting dental mouthpieces that help advance the position of your jaw, tongue and soft palate to keep your air passage open.\n",
      "If you choose to use an oral appliance, you'll work with your dental specialist to optimize the fit and position of the appliance. You'll also work with your sleep specialist to make sure the oral appliance is working as intended. Dental visits may be necessary at least once every six months during the first year, and then at least annually after that, to have the fit checked and to assess your oral health.\n",
      "Excessive salivation, dry mouth, jaw pain and facial discomfort are possible side effects from wearing these devices.\n",
      "- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This approach involves wearing a mask over your nose or mouth while you sleep. The mask directs pressurized air from a small bedside pump to your airway to keep it open during sleep.\n",
      "CPAP (SEE-pap) eliminates snoring and is most often used to treating snoring when associated with OSA.\n",
      "Although CPAP is the most reliable and effective method of treating OSA, some people find it uncomfortable or have trouble adjusting to the noise or feel of the machine.\n",
      "- Upper airway surgery. There are a number of procedures that seek to open the upper airway and prevent significant narrowing during sleep through a variety of techniques.\n",
      "For example, in a procedure called uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), you're given general anesthetics and your surgeon tightens and trims excess tissues from your throat — a type of face-lift for your throat. Another procedure called maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) involves moving the upper and lower jaws forward, which helps open the airway. Radiofrequency tissue ablation employs a low-intensity radiofrequency signal to shrink tissue in the soft palate, tongue or nose.\n",
      "A newer surgical technique called hypoglossal nerve stimulation employs a stimulus applied to the nerve that controls forward movement of the tongue so the tongue does not block the airway when you take a breath.\n",
      "The effectiveness of these surgeries varies and the response can be challenging to predict.\n",

      "Another medicine called droxidopa (Northera) also treats postural hypotension. The most common side effects of droxidopa include headaches, dizziness and nausea.\n",
      "- Medicines to reduce Parkinson's disease-like symptoms. Medicines that treat Parkinson's disease, such as combined levodopa and carbidopa (Sinemet, Duopa, others), can help some people with MSA. The medicine can treat stiffness, trouble with balance and slow movements.\n",
      "Many people with multiple system atrophy do not respond to Parkinson's medicines. The medicines also may become less effective after a few years.\n",
      "- Medicines to treat erection problems. If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection, you can be treated with medicines such as sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra). This medicine helps manage erectile dysfunction but it can lower blood pressure.\n",
      "- Steps to manage swallowing and breathing symptoms. If you have trouble swallowing, try eating softer foods. If swallowing or breathing symptoms become worse, you might need surgery to insert a feeding or breathing tube. A gastrostomy tube delivers food directly into your stomach.\n",
      "If you have sleep apnea, you might be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Stridor also can be treated with CPAP.\n",
      "- Bladder care. If you have trouble with bladder control, medicines can help in the earlier stages. But as MSA gets worse, you may need to have a soft tube inserted to drain your bladder. The soft tube is known as a catheter.\n",
      "- Therapy. A physical therapist can help you maintain as much of your movement and strength as possible as the disease gets worse.\n",

      "- Lifestyle changes to slow the buildup of fatty deposits. These might include quitting smoking, losing weight, eating healthy foods, reducing salt and exercising regularly.\n",
      "- Medicines to control blood pressure or lower cholesterol. This might include taking a daily aspirin or other blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots.\n",
      "For severe blockage or for people who've had a TIA or stroke, treatment might involve removing the blockage. The options include:\n",
      "- Carotid endarterectomy. This is the most common treatment for severe carotid artery disease. After cutting along the front of the neck, a surgeon opens the blocked carotid artery and removes the plaques. The surgeon uses stitches or a graft to repair the artery.\n",
      "- Carotid angioplasty and stenting. This treatment is for blockages too hard to reach with carotid endarterectomy or for people who have other health conditions that make surgery too risky. This involves a local numbing medicine, known as anesthesia.\n",
      "A surgeon uses a tube, known as a catheter, to send a tiny balloon to the area of the clog. The surgeon inflates the balloon to widen the artery. Then the surgeon puts in a small wire mesh coil, known as a stent, to keep the artery from narrowing again.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "If your doctor suspects cholangiocarcinoma, he or she may have you undergo one or more of the following tests:\n",
      "- Liver function tests. Blood tests to measure your liver function can give your doctor clues about what's causing your signs and symptoms.\n",
      "- Tumor marker test. Checking the level of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 in your blood may give your doctor additional clues about your diagnosis. CA 19-9 is a protein that's overproduced by bile duct cancer cells.\n",
      "A high level of CA 19-9 in your blood doesn't mean you have bile duct cancer, though. This result can also occur in other bile duct diseases, such as bile duct inflammation and obstruction.\n",
      "- A test to examine your bile duct with a small camera. During endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a thin, flexible tube equipped with a tiny camera is passed down your throat and through your digestive tract to your small intestine. The camera is used to examine the area where your bile ducts connect to your small intestine. Your doctor may also use this procedure to inject dye into the bile ducts to help them show up better on imaging tests.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. Imaging tests can help your doctor see your internal organs and look for signs of cholangiocarcinoma. Techniques used to diagnose bile duct cancer include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRCP is increasingly being used as a noninvasive alternative to ERCP. It offers 3D images without the need for a dye to enhance the images.\n",
      "- A procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope.\n",
      "If the suspicious area is located very near where the bile duct joins the small intestine, your doctor may obtain a biopsy sample during ERCP. If the suspicious area is within or near the liver, your doctor may obtain a tissue sample by inserting a long needle through your skin to the affected area (fine-needle aspiration). He or she may use an imaging test, such as an endoscopic ultrasound or CT scan, to guide the needle to the precise area.\n",
      "How your doctor collects a biopsy sample may influence which treatment options are available to you later. For example, if your bile duct cancer is biopsied by fine-needle aspiration, you will become ineligible for liver transplantation. Don't hesitate to ask about your doctor's experience with diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion.\n",
      "If your doctor confirms a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, he or she tries to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. Often this involves additional imaging tests. Your cancer's stage helps determine your prognosis and your treatment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatments for cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) may include:\n",
      "- Surgery. When possible, surgeons try to remove as much of the cancer as they can. For very small bile duct cancers, this involves removing part of the bile duct and joining the cut ends. For more-advanced bile duct cancers, nearby liver tissue, pancreas tissue or lymph nodes may be removed as well.\n",
      "- Liver transplant. Surgery to remove your liver and replace it with one from a donor (liver transplant) may be an option in certain situations for people with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. For many, a liver transplant can be a cure for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, but there is a risk that the cancer will recur after a liver transplant.\n",
      "- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be used before a liver transplant. It may also be an option for people with advanced cholangiocarcinoma to help slow the disease and relieve signs and symptoms. Chemotherapy drugs can be infused into a vein so that they travel throughout the body. Or the drugs can be administered in a way so that they are delivered directly to the cancer cells.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy beams from sources such as X-rays and protons to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy can involve a machine that directs radiation beams at your body (external beam radiation). Or it can involve placing radioactive material inside your body near the site of your cancer (brachytherapy).\n",
      "- Targeted drug therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within cancer cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Your doctor may test your cancer cells to see if targeted therapy may be effective against your cholangiocarcinoma.\n",
      "- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy uses your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process. For cholangiocarcinoma, immunotherapy might be an option for advanced cancer when other treatments haven't helped.\n",
      "- Heating cancer cells. Radiofrequency ablation uses electric current to heat and destroy cancer cells. Using an imaging test as a guide, such as ultrasound, the doctor inserts one or more thin needles into small incisions in your abdomen. When the needles reach the cancer, they're heated with an electric current, destroying the cancer cells.\n",
      "- Photodynamic therapy. In photodynamic therapy, a light-sensitive chemical is injected into a vein and accumulates in the fast-growing cancer cells. Laser light directed at the cancer causes a chemical reaction in the cancer cells, killing them. You'll typically need multiple treatments. Photodynamic therapy can help relieve your signs and symptoms, and it may also slow cancer growth. You'll need to avoid sun exposure after treatments.\n",
      "- Biliary drainage. Biliary drainage is a procedure to restore the flow of bile. It might involve placing a thin tube into the bile duct in order to drain the bile. Other strategies include bypass surgery to reroute the bile around the cancer and stents to hold open a bile duct being collapsed by cancer. Biliary drainage helps relieve signs and symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma.\n",
      "Because cholangiocarcinoma is a very difficult type of cancer to treat, don't hesitate to ask about your doctor's experience with treating the condition. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion.\n",

      "During the physical exam, health care providers will press on different parts of the affected shoulder and move your arm into different positions. They'll also test the strength of the muscles around your shoulder and in your arms.\n",
      "Imaging tests may include:\n",
      "- X-rays. Although a rotator cuff tear won't show up on an X-ray, this test can visualize bone spurs or other potential causes for your pain — such as arthritis.\n",
      "- Ultrasound. This type of test uses sound waves to produce images of structures within your body, particularly soft tissues such as muscles and tendons. It allows a provider to assess the structures of your shoulder during movement. It also allows a quick comparison between the affected shoulder and the healthy shoulder.\n",

      "To diagnose a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), your healthcare professional reviews your symptoms and conducts a physical exam.\n",
      "One or more tests may be used to diagnose brain AVM. Imaging tests are usually done by radiologists trained in brain and nervous system imaging, known as neuroradiologists.\n",
      "Tests used to diagnose brain AVMs include:\n",
      "- Cerebral angiography. This is the most detailed test to diagnose a brain AVM. Cerebral angiography reveals the location of the feeding arteries and draining veins, which is critical to planning treatment. Cerebral angiography is also known as cerebral arteriography.\n",
      "In this test, a long, thin tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist. The catheter is threaded to the brain using X-ray imaging. A dye is injected into the blood vessels of the brain to make them visible under X-ray imaging.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses a series of X-rays to create a detailed cross-sectional image of the brain.\n",
      "Sometimes a dye is injected through a tube into a vein for the CT scan. This type of test is known as computerized tomography angiography. The dye allows the arteries feeding the AVM and the veins draining the AVM to be viewed in greater detail.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain.\n",
      "MRI is more sensitive than CT and can show subtle changes in brain tissue related to a brain AVM.\n",
      "MRI also provides information about the exact location of the brain AVM and any related bleeding in the brain. The information is important for planning treatment.\n",
      "A dye also may be injected to see the blood circulation in the brain. This type of test is known as magnetic resonance angiography.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "There are several treatments for brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The main goal of treatment is to prevent bleeding, known as a hemorrhage. Treatment also can help control seizures or other brain symptoms.\n",
      "The proper treatment depends on your age, health, and the size and location of the brain AVM.\n",
      "Medicines may be used to treat symptoms caused by the AVM, such as headaches or seizures.\n",
      "Surgery is the most common treatment for brain AVMs. There are three surgical options:\n",
      "- Surgical removal, known as resection. Surgery may be recommended if the brain AVM has bled or is in an area that can easily be reached. In this procedure, the surgeon removes part of the skull to gain access to the AVM.\n",
      "With the help of a high-powered microscope, the surgeon seals off the AVM with special clips and carefully removes it from surrounding brain tissue. The surgeon then reattaches the skull bone and closes the incision in the scalp.\n",
      "Resection usually is done when the AVM can be removed with little risk of hemorrhage or seizure. AVMs that are in deep brain regions carry a higher risk of complications, and other treatments may be recommended.\n",
      "- Endovascular embolization. In this procedure, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg or wrist. The catheter is threaded through blood vessels to the brain using X-ray imaging.\n",
      "The catheter is positioned in one of the arteries that feeds the brain AVM. The surgeon injects an embolizing agent. This may be small particles, a gluelike substance, microcoils or other materials. The embolizing agent blocks the artery and reduces blood flow into the AVM.\n",
      "Endovascular embolization is less invasive than traditional surgery. It may be performed alone but it's often used before other surgical treatments to make them safer. It does this by reducing the size of the brain AVM or the likelihood of bleeding.\n",
      "In some large brain AVMs, endovascular embolization may be used to reduce stroke-like symptoms by redirecting blood back to brain tissue.\n",
      "- Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). This treatment uses precisely focused radiation to destroy the AVM. This type of surgery doesn't require cuts in the body the way other surgeries do.\n",
      "Instead, SRS directs many highly targeted radiation beams at the AVM to damage the blood vessels and cause scarring. The scarred AVM blood vessels then slowly close in 1 to 3 years.\n",
      "This treatment may be done for small AVMs that are hard to remove with traditional surgery. It also may be done for AVMs that haven't caused dangerous hemorrhages.\n",
      "Sometimes healthcare professionals decide to monitor a brain AVM rather than treating it. This may be recommended if you have few or no symptoms or if your AVM is in an area of your brain that's hard to treat. Monitoring includes regular medical checkups with your healthcare team.\n",

Your doctor might also take a small sample of your skin (skin biopsy) for examination in a laboratory. This can reveal changes in your skin, such as thickening of a protein (collagen) in the second layer of skin (dermis). Collagen makes up your connective tissues, including your skin. It helps make your skin elastic and resilient.\n",

      "- Medicated creams. Your doctor may prescribe a vitamin D cream, such as calcipotriene, to help soften the skin patches. Skin generally begins to improve during the first months of treatment. Possible side effects include burning, stinging and a rash.\n",
      "Or your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream to reduce inflammation. When used for a long time, these creams may thin the skin.\n",
      "- Light therapy. For severe or widespread morphea, treatment may include the use of ultraviolet light (phototherapy).\n",
      "- Oral medications. For severe or widespread morphea, your doctor may prescribe an immunosuppressive medication, such as oral methotrexate (Trexall), corticosteroid pills or both. Or your doctor may suggest hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) or mycophenolate mofetil. Each of these drugs has potential side effects.

      "The freezing causes a blister to form around your wart, and the dead tissue sloughs off within a week or so. Cryotherapy may also stimulate your immune system to fight viral warts. You may need to return to the clinic for repeat treatments every 2 to 3 weeks until the wart disappears.\n",
      "Possible side effects of cryotherapy are pain, blisters and permanent changes in skin color (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation), particularly in people with brown or Black skin.\n",
      "- Stronger peeling medicine (salicylic acid). Prescription-strength wart medications with salicylic acid work by removing a wart a layer at a time. They may also boost your immune system's ability to fight the wart.\n",

      "- Genetic testing. Genetic testing can reveal the changed gene that causes MCAD deficiency. Depending on the type of test, a sample of blood or saliva or cells from the inside of the cheek, the skin or other tissue is collected and sent to a lab to be tested. Your health care provider may also recommend testing family members for this gene. Genetic counseling can help you understand the testing process and what the results mean.\n",

      "- Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram can show whether the heart's rhythm is normal or irregular, and if the electrical signals that control the heartbeat are timed properly. This test is painless and involves the placement of more than a dozen electrical leads, which are attached to the body with a sticky adhesive.\n",
      "- Echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is a sonogram of the heart. It can show real-time images of how well the heart and its valves are working. The images are produced by transmitting sound waves via a wand pressed against the chest. An echocardiogram also gives your doctor a look at how the chest wall may be affecting heart function and the flow of blood through the heart.\n",

      "Testing for tongue cancer may include:\n",
      "- Examining the mouth and throat. In a physical exam, a member of your health care team looks at your mouth, throat and neck. That person checks for any lumps on the tongue and for swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\n",
      "- Using a tiny camera to look at the mouth and throat. Called an endoscopy, this test uses a thin tube with a light and camera.

It also may be used to see if the cancer has spread by looking at other parts of the throat, such as the voice box.\n",
      "- Removing a tissue sample for testing. Called a biopsy, this test involves taking a sample of cells from the tongue. There are different types of biopsy procedures. A sample may be collected by cutting out a piece of the suspicious tissue or the entire area. Another type of biopsy uses a thin needle that's inserted directly into the suspicious area to collect a sample of cells. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. In the lab, tests can show whether the cells are cancerous. Other tests give more information about the cancer cells, such as if they show signs of HPV.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. Imaging tests capture pictures of the body. The pictures can show the size and location of the cancer. Imaging tests used for tongue cancer may include X-rays and CT, MRI and positron emission tomography, also called PET, scans.\n",
      "Sometimes an X-ray involves a barium swallow. In this type of X-ray, a liquid called barium helps to check for signs of cancer in the throat. Barium coats the throat and makes it easier to see on X-rays. An ultrasound may be used to look for cancer in the lymph nodes. Ultrasound creates pictures using sound waves.

Immune system function improves with age for most children whose thymus has been moderately harmed.\n",
      "- Severe thymus dysfunction. If the harm to the thymus is severe or there's no thymus, your child is at risk of several severe infections. Treatment may require a transplant of thymus tissue and specialized cells from bone marrow or specialized disease-fighting blood cells.\n",
      "- Cleft palate. A cleft palate or other unusual features of the palate and lip usually can be repaired by surgery.\n",

      "In more severe injuries, where the muscle or tendon has been completely ruptured, your doctor may be able to see or feel a defect in the area of injury. Ultrasound often can help distinguish among several different types of soft tissue injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "For immediate self-care of a muscle strain, try the R.I.C.E. approach — rest, ice, compression, elevation:\n",
      "- Rest. Avoid activities that cause pain, swelling or discomfort. But don't avoid all physical activity.\n",
      "- Ice. Even if you're seeking medical help, ice the area immediately. Use an ice pack or slush bath of ice and water for 15 to 20 minutes each time and repeat every two to three hours while you're awake for the first few days after the injury.\n",
      "- Compression. To help stop swelling, compress the area with an elastic bandage until the swelling stops. Don't wrap it too tightly or you may hinder circulation. Begin wrapping at the end farthest from your heart. Loosen the wrap if the pain increases, the area becomes numb or swelling is occurring below the wrapped area.\n",
      "- Elevation. Elevate the injured area above the level of your heart, especially at night, which allows gravity to help reduce swelling.\n",
      "Some doctors recommend avoiding over-the-counter pain medications that can increase your risk of bleeding — such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) — during the first 48 hours after a muscle strain. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can be helpful for pain relief during this time period.\n",
      "A physical therapist can help you to maximize stability and strength of the injured joint or limb. Your doctor may suggest that you immobilize the area with a brace or splint. For some injuries, such as a torn tendon, surgery may be considered.\n",

      "Treatment:\n",
      "Dislocated shoulder treatment might involve:\n",
      "- Closed reduction. In this procedure, some gentle maneuvers might help move the shoulder bones back into position. Depending on the amount of pain and swelling, a muscle relaxant or sedative or, rarely, a general anesthetic might be given before moving the shoulder bones. When the shoulder bones are back in place, severe pain should improve almost immediately.\n",
      "- Surgery. Surgery might help those with weak shoulder joints or ligaments who have repeated shoulder dislocations despite strengthening and rehabilitation. In rare cases, damaged nerves or blood vessels might require surgery. Surgical treatment might also reduce the risk of re-injury in young athletes.\n",
      "- Immobilization. After closed reduction, wearing a special splint or sling for a few weeks can keep the shoulder from moving while it heals.\n",
      "- Medication. A pain reliever or a muscle relaxant might provide comfort while the shoulder heals.\n",
      "- Rehabilitation. When the splint or sling is no longer needed, a rehabilitation program can help restore range of motion, strength and stability to the shoulder joint.\n",
      "A fairly simple shoulder dislocation without major nerve or tissue damage likely will improve over a few weeks. Having full range of motion without pain and regained strength are necessary before returning to regular activities.

      "- Blood tests. You may need a complete blood count, a test to see how fast your blood clots, a platelet count and liver function tests.\n",
      "- Stool tests. Analyzing your stool can help determine the cause of occult bleeding.\n",
      "- Nasogastric lavage. A tube is passed through your nose into the stomach to remove stomach contents. This might help find the source of the bleeding.\n",
      "- Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy is a procedure that uses a camera to view the upper digestive system. The camera is attached to a long, thin tube, called an endoscope, and passed down the throat to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n",
      "- Colonoscopy. During a colonoscopy, a long, flexible tube is inserted into the rectum. A tiny video camera at the tip of the tube allows the doctor to view the inside of the entire large intestine and rectum.\n",
      "- Capsule endoscopy. In this procedure, you swallow a vitamin-size capsule with a tiny camera inside. The capsule travels through your digestive tract taking thousands of pictures that are sent to a recorder you wear on a belt around your waist.\n",
      "- Flexible sigmoidoscopy. A tube with a light and camera is placed in the rectum to look at the rectum and the last part of the large intestine, known as the sigmoid colon.\n",
      "- Balloon-assisted enteroscopy. A specialized scope inspects parts of the small intestine that other tests using an endoscope can't reach. Sometimes, the source of bleeding can be controlled or treated during this test.\n",
      "- Angiography. A contrast dye is injected into an artery, and a series of X-rays are taken to look for and treat bleeding vessels or other issues.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. A variety of other imaging tests, such as a CT scan of the belly, might be used to find the source of the bleed.\n",
      "If your GI bleeding is severe, and noninvasive tests can't find the source, you might need surgery so that doctors can view the entire small intestine. Fortunately, this is rare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "GI bleeding often stops on its own. If it doesn't, treatment depends on where the bleed is from. In many cases, bleeding can be treated with medicine or a procedure during a test. For example, it's sometimes possible to treat a bleeding peptic ulcer during an upper endoscopy or to remove polyps during a colonoscopy.\n",
      "If you have an upper GI bleed, you will be given an IV drug known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to suppress stomach acid production. Once the source of the bleeding is identified, your doctor will determine whether you need to continue taking a PPI.\n",
      "Depending on the amount of blood loss and whether you continue to bleed, you might need fluids through a needle (IV) and, possibly, blood transfusions. If you take blood-thinning medicines, including aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, you might need to stop.\n",

      "- Blood tests. Blood tests can't detect small bowel cancer, but they can give clues about your health. A blood test called a complete blood count can detect a low red blood cell count. The red blood cells could be low if small bowel cancer is causing bleeding. Blood tests also can show how well the organs are working. For example, results on kidney or liver function tests could be a clue that the cancer has spread to those organs.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. Imaging tests create pictures of the body. They can show the location and size of small bowel cancer. Tests might include MRI, CT and positron emission tomography, also called a PET scan.\n",
      "- Removing a sample of tissue for testing, also called a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue for testing in a lab. The tissue might be removed during a procedure to see inside the small intestine. During this type of procedure, special tools can be put into the small intestine to collect the sample. Sometimes surgery is needed to get the tissue sample. The sample is tested in a lab to see if it is cancer. Other special tests give more details about the cancer cells. Your health care team uses this information to make a treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for small bowel cancer usually involves surgery to remove the cancer. Other options might be chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Your health care team considers the location of your cancer and its type when creating a treatment plan. They also consider your overall health and your preferences.\n",
      "Small bowel cancer treatments might include:\n",
      "- Surgery. Surgeons work to remove all of the small bowel cancer, when possible. If cancer affects a small part of the small intestine, the surgeon may remove only that section. The surgeon then rejoins the cut ends of the intestine. Sometimes all of the small intestine needs to be removed. The surrounding lymph nodes also may be removed to see if there is a risk of the cancer spreading.\n",
      "If a small bowel cancer can't be removed, a surgeon might perform a bypass to relieve a blockage in the small intestine.\n",
      "- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses strong medicines to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy usually involves a combination of medicines that kill fast-growing cells, including cancer cells. It's typically given through a vein, but some medicines come in pill form.\n",
      "For small bowel cancer, chemotherapy might be used after surgery if there's a risk that the cancer could return. For advanced cancer, chemotherapy might help relieve symptoms. If the cancer is too big to be removed with surgery, it may first be treated with chemotherapy to shrink it.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells. The energy can come from X-rays, protons or other sources. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you. The machine directs radiation to precise points on your body. Radiation therapy is sometimes combined with chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the size of the cancer.\n",
      "- Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Targeted therapy might be used for small bowel cancer when surgery isn't an option or when the cancer spreads to other parts of the body.\n",
      "- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a treatment with medicine that helps your body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Your immune system fights off diseases by attacking germs and other cells that shouldn't be in your body. Cancer cells survive by hiding from the immune system. Immunotherapy helps the immune system cells find and kill the cancer cells. Immunotherapy might be an option for advanced small bowel cancer if testing shows the cancer cells may respond to this type of treatment.\n",

      "- Pelvic MRI scan. This looks at the pelvic bone to see how it's involved with the condition.\n",
      "- Retrograde urethrogram. This test uses X-ray images to look for a problem or injury of the urethra. It also shows how long the stricture is and where it is.\n",
      "- Cystoscopy. This uses a thin, tubelike tool that has a lens, called a cystoscope. The tool looks inside the urethra and bladder.\n",

      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment might depend on the type of stricture, its size and how bad the symptoms are. Treatments can include:\n",
      "- Catheterization. Putting a small tube called a catheter into the bladder to drain urine is often the first step for treating urine blockage. Antibiotics treat an infection if there is one. Self-catheterization might be a choice for those diagnosed with a short stricture.\n",
      "- Widening, called dilation. This starts with a tiny wire put through the urethra and into the bladder. Larger and larger dilators pass over the wire to increase the size of the opening of the urethra little by little. This outpatient procedure may be a choice to treat recurrent urethral strictures.\n",
      "- Urethroplasty. This involves surgically removing the narrowed section of the urethra or making it larger. The procedure might also involve rebuilding tissues around the urethra.\n",
      "Tissues from other areas of the body, such as the skin or mouth, may be used as a graft during the process. The chance of urethral stricture coming back after a urethroplasty is low.\n",
      "- Endoscopic urethrotomy. This procedure uses a thin, tubelike tool that has a lens, called a cystoscope. The cystoscope goes into the urethra. Then a tool is put through the cystoscope to remove the stricture or treat it with a laser.\n",
      "This surgical procedure has a faster recovery than do some other procedures. It doesn't leave much scarring, and the risk of infection is low. However, urethral stricture can come back after this procedure.\n",
      "- Implanted stent or long-term catheter. This treatment might be for people with a severe stricture who don't want surgery. A tube, called a stent, is put into the urethra to keep it open, Or a permanent catheter is put in to drain the bladder.\n",

First, small electrodes are attached to the scalp. You then may be asked to breathe deeply and steadily and look at bright lights or listen to sounds. These actions may uncover irregular electrical activity.\n",
      "- Electromyography (EMG). In this procedure, electrodes are placed on multiple muscles, especially muscles that are involved in the jerking.\n",
      "An instrument records the electrical activity from the muscles when they are at rest and when they are contracted, such as when you bend your arm. These signals help determine the pattern and origin of the myoclonus.\n",
      "- Evoked potential studies. These tests measure the electrical activity of the brain, brainstem and spinal cord that is triggered by touch, sound, sight and other stimuli.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI scan may be used to check for structural problems or tumors inside the brain or spinal cord, which may cause the myoclonus symptoms. An MRI scan uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain, spinal cord and other areas of the body.\n",
      "- Laboratory tests. Your health care provider may suggest genetic testing to help identify possible causes of myoclonus. Blood or urine tests may be needed to check for metabolic disorders, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and kidney or liver disease. They also can check for drugs or toxins.\n",
      "\n",

There are no drugs specifically designed to treat myoclonus. But treatments for other diseases may help relieve myoclonus symptoms. More than one drug may be needed to control the symptoms.\n",

      "- Hormone therapy. Systemic estrogen therapy — which comes in pill, skin patch, spray, gel or cream form — remains the most effective treatment option for relieving perimenopausal and menopausal hot flashes and night sweats. Depending on your personal and family medical history, your doctor may recommend estrogen in the lowest dose needed to provide symptom relief for you. If you still have your uterus, you'll need progestin in addition to estrogen. Systemic estrogen can help prevent bone loss.\n",
      "- Vaginal estrogen. Estrogen can be administered directly to the vagina using a vaginal tablet, ring or cream. This treatment releases just a small amount of estrogen, which is absorbed by the vaginal tissue. It can help relieve vaginal dryness, discomfort with intercourse and some urinary symptoms.\n",
      "- Antidepressants. Certain antidepressants related to the class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may reduce menopausal hot flashes. An antidepressant for management of hot flashes may be useful for women who can't take estrogen for health reasons or for women who need an antidepressant for a mood disorder.\n",
      "- Gabapentin (Neurontin). Gabapentin is approved to treat seizures, but it has also been shown to help reduce hot flashes. This drug is useful for women who can't use estrogen therapy for health reasons and for those who also have migraines.\n",
      "- Fezolinetant (Veozah). This medicine is a hormone-free option for treating menopause hot flashes. It works by blocking a pathway in the brain that helps regulate body temperature.\n",

      "- Lab tests. Blood and urine tests can help find or rule out possible causes of poor weight gain and vomiting that happens often.\n",
      "- Esophageal pH monitoring. To measure the acidity in a baby's esophagus, the health professional places a thin tube through the baby's nose or mouth and into the esophagus. The tube is attached to a device that monitors acidity. A baby might need to stay in the hospital while being monitored.\n",
      "- X-rays. These images can detect problems in the digestive tract, such as a blockage. A baby may be given a contrast liquid with a bottle before the test. This liquid is usually barium.\n",
      "- Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube called an endoscope to visually examine the upper digestive system.

You also may have a test called videostrobolaryngoscopy. It uses a special scope that contains a tiny camera at its tip or a larger camera connected to the scope's viewing piece.\n",
      "These special high-magnification endoscopes allow your healthcare professional to view your vocal cords directly or on a video monitor. The tests reveal the movement and position of the vocal cords. This can tell your healthcare professional whether one or both vocal cords are affected.\n",
      "- Laryngeal electromyography. This test measures the electrical currents in your voice box muscles. To do this, small needles are inserted into the vocal cord muscles through the skin of the neck.\n",
      "This test isn't used to guide treatment, but it may give an estimate about how well you may recover. This test is most useful when it's done between six weeks and six months after your symptoms began.\n",
      "- Blood tests and scans. Several diseases may cause nerve injuries. You may need additional tests to find the cause of the paralysis. Tests may include bloodwork, X-rays, MRI or CT scans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment of vocal cord paralysis depends on the cause, how serious the symptoms are and when symptoms began. Treatment may include voice therapy, bulk injections, surgery or a combination of treatments.\n",
      "In some instances, you may get better without surgical treatment. For this reason, your healthcare team may delay permanent surgery for at least a year from the beginning of your vocal cord paralysis.\n",
      "However, surgical treatment with various bulk injections is often done within the first three months of voice loss.\n",
      "During the waiting period for surgery, you may get voice therapy to help keep you from using your voice improperly while the nerves heal.\n",

      "- Physical exam. Your doctor will perform a physical exam. This includes a check of vital signs, such as pulse and blood pressure, as well as checks of your lymph nodes, spleen and abdomen.\n",
      "- Blood tests. In myelofibrosis, a complete blood count typically shows abnormally low levels of red blood cells, a sign of anemia common in people with myelofibrosis. White blood cell and platelet counts are usually abnormal, too. Often, white blood cell levels are higher than normal, although in some people they may be normal or even lower than normal. Platelet counts may be higher or lower than normal.\n",

      "- Bone marrow examination. Bone marrow biopsy and aspiration can confirm a diagnosis of myelofibrosis.\n",
      "In a bone marrow biopsy, a needle is used to draw a sample of bone tissue and the enclosed marrow from your hipbone.

      "In order to determine which myelofibrosis treatments are most likely to benefit you, your doctor may use one or more formulas to assess your condition. These formulas take into account many aspects of your cancer and your overall health to assign a risk category that indicates the aggressiveness of the disease.\n",
      "Low-risk myelofibrosis may not require immediate treatment, while people with high-risk myelofibrosis may consider an aggressive treatment, such as bone marrow transplant. For intermediate-risk myelofibrosis, treatment is usually directed at managing symptoms.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Diagnosing frostbite is based on your symptoms and a review of recent activities during which you were exposed to cold.\n",
      "Your healthcare team may have you undergo X-rays or an MRI to look for bone or muscle damage. It may take 2 to 4 days after rewarming to tell the extent of tissue damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "First aid for frostbite is as follows:\n",
      "- If you suspect hypothermia, call for emergency help.\n",
      "- Protect the injured area from further damage. Do not try to rewarm the frostbitten skin if it might freeze again.\n",
      "- Get out of the cold, remove wet clothes and wrap up in a warm blanket.\n",
      "- If possible, soak the skin with frostbite in a tub or sink of warm water for about 30 minutes. For frostbite on the nose or ears, cover the area with warm, wet cloths for about 30 minutes.\n",
      "Another option is to warm the affected skin with body heat. For example, tuck frostbitten fingers under an armpit.\n",
      "- Don't walk on frostbitten feet or toes if possible.\n",
      "- Take a nonprescription pain reliever if needed.\n",
      "- Drink a warm, nonalcoholic beverage.\n",
      "- Remove rings or other tight items. Do this before the injured area swells with rewarming.\n",
      "- Don't apply direct heat. For example, don't warm the skin with a heating pad, a heat lamp, a blow-dryer or a car heater.\n",
      "- Don't rub the frostbitten skin.\n",
      "After providing first aid, seek treatment from a healthcare professional if you have frostbite. Treatment may involve rewarming, medicine, wound care, surgery or other steps depending on how serious the injury is.\n",
      "- Rewarm the skin. If the skin hasn't been rewarmed already, your healthcare team rewarms the area using a warm-water bath for 15 to 30 minutes. The skin may turn soft. You may be asked to gently move the affected area as it rewarms.\n",
      "- Take pain medicine. Because the rewarming process can be painful, you may be given a pain reliever.\n",
      "- Protect the injury. Once the skin thaws, your healthcare team may loosely wrap the area with sterile sheets, towels or dressings to protect the skin. You may need to raise the affected area to reduce swelling.\n",
      "- Soak in a whirlpool. Soaking in a whirlpool bath can aid healing, as it keeps the skin clean and naturally removes dead tissue.\n",
      "- Take infection-fighting drugs. If the skin or blisters look infected, your healthcare team may prescribe antibiotic medicine taken by mouth.\n",
      "- Take medicine. You may receive an injection of medicine in a vein that helps restore blood flow. This type of medicine is called a thrombolytic. One example is tissue plasminogen activator, also called TPA. Studies of people with severe frostbite show that TPA may lower the risk of amputation. But this medicine can cause serious bleeding. It's sometimes used in serious situations and within 24 hours of cold exposure. \n",
      "Another medicine that improves blood flow is iloprost (Aurlumyn). It was recently approved by the FDA for severe frostbite in adults. It can reduce the risk of finger or toe amputation. Side effects of this medicine include headache, flushing and heart palpitations.\n",
      "- Remove damaged tissue. To heal properly, frostbitten skin needs to be free of damaged, dead or infected tissue. This procedure to remove this tissue is called debridement.\n",
      "- Tend to blisters and wounds. Blisters can act as a natural dressing. Depending on the type of blisters, your healthcare team may leave them to heal on their own or drain them. A variety of wound care techniques may be used depending on the extent of injury.\n",
      "- Undergo surgery. People who have experienced severe frostbite may in time need surgery or amputation to remove dead or decaying tissue.\n",

      "- Fill your water bottle. Sip water or fruit juice to prevent dehydration. Resist any temptation to treat your hangover with more alcohol. It'll only make you feel worse.\n",
      "- Have a snack. Bland foods, such as toast and crackers, may boost your blood sugar and settle your stomach. Bouillon soup can help replace lost salt and potassium.\n",
      "- Take a pain reliever. A standard dose of a pain reliever you can buy without a prescription may ease a headache. But be careful about using these medicines with alcohol. Aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) can irritate your stomach. The combination of alcohol and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can cause serious liver damage.\n",

      "Imaging tests, such as an ultrasound and MRI, usually aren't needed to find out if a baby has an undescended testicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "The goal of treatment is to move the undescended testicle to its proper place in the scrotum. Treatment before age 1 might lower the risk of health problems linked with an undescended testicle, such as infertility and testicular cancer. Earlier treatment is better. Experts often recommend that surgery take place before the child is 18 months old.\n",

      "- Blood tests. People who have broken heart syndrome often have higher levels of substances called cardiac enzymes in the blood.\n",
      "- Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This quick test measures the electrical activity of the heart. Sticky patches called electrodes are placed on the chest and sometimes the arms and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a computer, which shows the test results.\n",
      "An ECG shows how fast or how slow the heart is beating. ECG results for broken heart syndrome look different from those for a heart attack.\n",
      "- Coronary angiogram. This test checks for blockages in the heart arteries. It's done to rule out a heart attack. People with broken heart syndrome often don't have any blockages. A doctor inserts a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. It's guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images and video.\n",
      "    \n",
      "Once it's clear that you're not having a heart attack, your doctor checks to see if your symptoms are caused by broken heart syndrome.\n",
      "- Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to create pictures of the beating heart. It shows how blood flows through the heart and heart valves. It can see if the heart is enlarged or has an unusual shape. These changes may be due to broken heart syndrome.\n",
      "- Cardiac MRI. This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart.\n",
      "\n",

      "- Going over symptoms happening in your mouth and any other places on your body.\n",
      "- Looking at your mouth and other areas as needed.\n",
      "Your healthcare professional also may request lab tests, such as:\n",
      "- A biopsy. In this test, a small tissue sample is taken from one or more spots in your mouth. This sample is studied under a microscope to see if oral lichen planus is present. Other, more specialized microscopic tests may be needed to find immune system proteins commonly related to oral lichen planus.\n",
      "- Cultures. A sample of cells is taken from your mouth using a cotton swab. The sample is examined under a microscope to look for a secondary fungal, bacterial or viral infection.\n",
      "- Blood tests. These tests may be done to find conditions such as hepatitis C, which may rarely be related to oral lichen planus, and lupus, which may look like oral lichen planus.\n",

This type of device provides a detailed view of your whole eye. It lets your healthcare professional see any retinal holes, tears or detachments.\n",
      "- Ultrasound imaging. Your healthcare professional may use this test if bleeding has happened in your eye. Bleeding makes it hard to see the retina.\n",
      "Your healthcare professional likely will check both eyes even if you have symptoms in just one. If a retinal tear is not found at this visit, your healthcare professional may ask you to return within a few weeks. The return visit is done to confirm that your eye has not developed a delayed retinal tear due to the same vitreous detachment. Also, if you have new symptoms, it's important to return to your healthcare professional right away.\n",

      "Most women have few signs of primary ovarian insufficiency, but your health care provider may suspect the condition if you have irregular periods or are having trouble conceiving. Diagnosis usually involves a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. Your provider might ask questions about your menstrual cycle, exposure to toxins, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and previous ovarian surgery.\n",
      "Your provider might recommend one or more tests to check for:\n",
      "- Pregnancy. A pregnancy test checks for an unexpected pregnancy if you're of childbearing age and missed a period.\n",
      "- Hormone levels. Your provider may check the levels of a number of hormones in your blood, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a type of estrogen called estradiol, and the hormone that stimulates breast milk production (prolactin).\n",
      "- Chromosome changes or certain genes. You may have a blood test called a karyotype analysis to look for unusual changes in your chromosomes. Your doctor may also check to see if you have a gene associated with fragile X syndrome called FMR1.\n",

      "Treatment:\n",
      "Most often, treatment for primary ovarian insufficiency focuses on the problems that arise from estrogen deficiency. (1p3) Treatment might include:\n",
      "- Estrogen therapy. Estrogen therapy can help prevent osteoporosis. It also can relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of low estrogen. You'll likely be prescribed estrogen with the hormone progesterone if you still have your uterus. Adding progesterone protects the lining of your uterus, called the endometrium, from changes that could lead to cancer. These changes may be caused by taking estrogen alone.\n",
      "The combination of hormones may make your period come back. It won't restore your ovaries' function. Depending on your health and preference, you might take hormone therapy until around age 50 or 51. That's the average age of natural menopause.\n",
      "In older women, long-term estrogen plus progesterone treatment has been linked to a higher risk of heart and blood vessel disease and breast cancer. In young people with primary ovarian insufficiency, the benefits of hormone therapy outweigh the risks.\n",
      "- Calcium and vitamin D supplements. Both nutrients are key for preventing osteoporosis. And you might not get enough of either in your diet or from sunlight. Your health care team might suggest an X-ray test that measures calcium and other minerals in bones before you start supplements. This is called a bone density test.\n",
      "For women ages 19 through 50, experts most often recommend 1,000 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day through food or supplements. The amount increases to 1,200 mg a day for women age 51 and older.\n",
      "The ideal daily dose of vitamin D isn't yet clear. A good starting point is 800 to 1,000 international units (IU) a day, through food or supplements. If your blood levels of vitamin D are low, your health care team might suggest higher amounts.\n",

      "- OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), which may be injected in small doses into the muscles around your eyes. Botox blocks the chemical signals that cause muscles to contract, which can improve eyelid spasms.\n",
      "- Antidepressants. Some antidepressant medicines may have a modest effect on symptoms such as impulsive behavior.\n",
      "- Eyeglasses with bifocal or prism lenses, which may help ease problems with looking downward. Prism lenses allow people with progressive supranuclear palsy to see downward without moving their eyes down.\n",
      "- Speech and swallowing evaluations, to help you learn other ways to communicate and safer swallowing techniques.\n",

      "- Physical exam. During a physical exam, your doctor will examine your lip, mouth, face and neck to look for signs of cancer. Your doctor will ask you about your signs and symptoms.\n",
      "- Removing a sample of tissue for testing. During a biopsy, your doctor will remove a small sample of tissue for laboratory testing. In the laboratory, a doctor who analyzes body tissue (pathologist) can determine whether cancer is present, the type of cancer and the level of aggressiveness that's present in the cancer cells.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. Imaging tests may be used to determine whether cancer has spread beyond the lip. Imaging tests may include computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET).\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Lip cancer treatments include:\n",
      "- Surgery. Surgery is used to remove the lip cancer and a margin of healthy tissue that surrounds it. The surgeon then repairs the lip to allow for normal eating, drinking and speaking. Techniques to reduce scarring also are used.\n",
      "For small lip cancers, repairing the lip after surgery may be a simple procedure. But for larger lip cancers, skilled plastic and reconstructive surgeons may be needed to repair the lip. Reconstructive surgery may involve moving tissue and skin to the face from another part of the body.\n",
      "Surgery for lip cancer may also involve removing cancerous lymph nodes in the neck.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy for lip cancer may be used on its own or it may be used after surgery. The radiation may be aimed only at your lip, or it may also be aimed at the lymph nodes in your neck.\n",
      "Radiation therapy for lip cancer most often comes from a large machine that precisely focuses the energy beams. But in some cases, the radiation can be placed directly on your lip and left in place for a short time. This procedure, called brachytherapy, allows doctors to use higher doses of radiation.\n",
      "- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses powerful drugs to kill cancer cells. For lip cancer, chemotherapy is sometimes used in combination with radiation therapy to increase the effectiveness of treatment. In cases of advanced lip cancer that has spread to other areas of the body, chemotherapy may be used to reduce signs and symptoms and make you more comfortable.\n",
      "- Targeted drug therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific weaknesses present within cancer cells. By blocking these weaknesses, targeted drug treatments can cause cancer cells to die. Targeted drug therapy is usually combined with chemotherapy.\n",
      "- Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a drug treatment that helps your immune system to fight cancer. Your body's disease-fighting immune system might not attack cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process. For cancer of the lip, immunotherapy might be considered when the cancer is advanced and other treatments aren't an option.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "A diagnosis of wrinkles involves looking at the skin to assess the lines and creases and what may have caused them. Your doctor also talks with you about your medical history and what's important to you. This discussion helps inform the decision on which treatments might best meet your needs and goals related to results, side effects and recovery time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Several wrinkle treatment options are available to help smooth wrinkles. Your doctor may suggest two or more treatments for the best result.\n",
      "- Prescription creams and serums. Your doctor may prescribe an anti-wrinkle product with prescription-strength retinoids. This ingredient is derived from vitamin A. These creams and serums are intended to reduce fine wrinkles and splotches. You may need to use the product for a few weeks or months before you notice improvement. Examples are tretinoin (Renova, Retin-A), tazarotene (Avage, Tazorac) and adapalene (Differin). Differin is now available without a prescription. Retinoids might cause a rash, burning or dryness. Products with retinoids are not for use when pregnant.\n",
      "Retinoids can make the skin sensitive to the sun, so you may be advised to use the product at bedtime. If you use it during the day, also apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. And wear protective clothing, such as a wide-brimmed hat.\n",
      "- Botox injections. When injected in small doses into specific muscles, Botox prevents the muscles from moving. This helps skin look smoother.\n",
      "Botox works well on frown lines between the eyebrows and across the forehead and on crow's-feet. It may take up to seven days to see results. The effect typically lasts a few months. Repeat injections are needed to maintain results.\n",
      "Possible side effects are headache, droopy eyelids, and pain, swelling, or bruising at the injection site.\n",
      "- Chemical peel. A chemical peel may be done as an outpatient procedure. Often numbing is not required. You may be given medicine to put you in a sleep-like state for extensive resurfacing. Then a member of your healthcare team applies a chemical solution to the skin to remove the top layers. The skin that grows back is smoother. Depending on the depth of the peel, you may need several treatments before you see a difference in your skin.\n",
      "Possible side effects include scarring, infection and changes in skin color of the treated area. People with brown or Black skin have a higher risk of long-term skin color changes.\n",
      "- Facial fillers. Facial fillers are products injected into the skin. The fillers plump and smooth lines and creases. Examples are calcium hydroxylapatite (Radiesse), poly-L-lactic acid (Sculptra) and hyaluronic acid (Restylane, Juvederm, others). It may take 1 to 3 sessions to achieve the result you're looking for. After about six months, repeat injections are needed to maintain results.\n",
      "Possible side effects are inflamed skin, bruising and changes in skin color. These tend to clear up within weeks.\n",
      "- Laser resurfacing. Laser resurfacing is a general term for facial rejuvenation procedures that use energy to improve the skin's appearance. These procedures can smooth the skin, but they can't fix sagging skin.\n",
      "A method called ablative laser resurfacing uses a beam of energy to destroy the outer layer of skin and heat the underlying skin. This stimulates the growth of collagen. As the wound heals, the new collagen leads to smoother, tighter skin. On average, it takes 7 to 10 days to recover.\n",
      "A method called nonablative laser resurfacing also stimulates collagen growth, but it's a less aggressive approach with more subtle results. It has a shorter recovery time than does the ablative method. Nonablative resurfacing can be a good option for people with moderate wrinkles.\n",
      "Either of these methods can be done with a fractional laser, which leaves microscopic columns of untreated tissue throughout the treatment area. A procedure done with a fractional laser may have a shorter recovery time and reduce the risk of side effects. You'll likely need more than one treatment session.\n",
      "Laser resurfacing risks include scarring, infection and skin color changes in the treated area. People with brown or Black skin have a higher risk of long-term skin color changes. If this is a concern, seek out an expert with experience in selecting lasers and settings for a range of skin colors. Before treatment, talk with your doctor about any history of hyperpigmentation or keloid formation.\n",
      "- Deoxycholic acid injections. Deoxycholic acid (Kybella) injections are used to treat excess fat under the chin. This condition is often called a double chin. Deoxycholic acid is injected under the skin. It works to dissolve the extra fat cells. The result is a reduction in fullness under the chin. Repeat injections are usually needed.\n",
      "Possible side effects are swelling, pain, numbness, bruising and hardness under the skin in the treated area.\n",
      "- Face-lift and neck lift. Face-lift surgery involves lifting the skin and tightening the underlying muscle and tissues. The goal is to improve the look of the jawline, neck and lower face. A neck lift is often done at the same time. A face-lift won't correct fine wrinkles, sun damage, uneven skin color, or creases around the nose and upper lip.\n",
      "These surgeries may be done in a hospital or an outpatient surgical facility. Before the procedure, you're given an injection to numb the treatment area, medicine to relax you or medicine to put you in a sleep-like state.\n",
      "Risks include bleeding, infection and a collection of blood under the skin, which is called a hematoma. Healing times can be lengthy. Bruising and swelling won't clear up for several weeks after surgery.\n",
      "Face-lift and neck lift results aren't permanent. You may choose to undergo another surgery several years later.\n",
      "Products, procedures and surgeries to enhance your appearance usually aren't covered by insurance. Also, many of these treatments can have side effects, so be sure to discuss them with your doctor. Ask how many times they've done the treatment you're considering and if they have experience in treating people with your skin color.\n",

      "- Stone analysis, to find out what kidney stones are made of after you've passed them through urine or gotten them removed with surgery.\n",
      "- Kidney X-ray, ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) scan, to check for any kidney stones or calcium oxalate buildup in the body.\n",
      "You may need more tests to find out for sure if you have hyperoxaluria and see how the disease has affected other parts of your body. These tests may include:\n",
      "- DNA testing to look for the gene changes that cause primary hyperoxaluria.\n",
      "- Kidney biopsy to check for buildup of oxalate.\n",
      "- Echocardiogram, an imaging test that can check for oxalate buildup in the heart.\n",
      "- Eye exam to check for oxalate deposits in the eyes.\n",
      "- Bone marrow biopsy to check for buildup of oxalate in the bones.\n",
      "- Liver biopsy to look for low levels of proteins, also called enzyme deficiencies. This test is needed only in rare cases when genetic testing doesn't show the cause of hyperoxaluria.\n",
      "If you learn you have primary hyperoxaluria, your siblings also are at risk of the disease. They should have tests as well. If your child has primary hyperoxaluria, you may want to get genetic testing if you and your partner plan to have more children. Medical genetics counselors who have experience with hyperoxaluria can help guide your decisions and testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Your eye care specialist conducts a complete eye exam to determine the cause of your eye floaters. Your exam usually includes eye dilation. Eye drops widen (dilate) the dark center of your eye. This allows your specialist to better see the back of your eyes and the vitreous.\n",
      "\n",

      "Most eye floaters don't require treatment. However, any medical condition that is the cause of eye floaters, such as bleeding from diabetes or inflammation, should be treated.\n",
      "Eye floaters can be frustrating and adjusting to them can take time. Once you know the floaters will not cause any more problems, over time you may be able to ignore them or notice them less often.\n",
      "If your eye floaters get in the way of your vision, which happens rarely, you and your eye care specialist may consider treatment. Options may include surgery to remove the vitreous or a laser to disrupt the floaters, although both procedures are rarely done.\n",
      "- Surgery to remove the vitreous. An ophthalmologist who is a specialist in retina and vitreous surgery removes the vitreous through a small incision (vitrectomy). The vitreous is replaced with a solution to help your eye maintain its shape. Surgery may not remove all the floaters, and new floaters can develop after surgery. Risks of a vitrectomy include infection, bleeding and retinal tears.\n",
      "- Using a laser to disrupt the floaters. An ophthalmologist aims a special laser at the floaters in the vitreous (vitreolysis). This may break up the floaters and make them less noticeable. Some people who have this treatment report improved vision; others notice little or no difference. Risks of laser therapy include damage to your retina if the laser is aimed incorrectly.\n",

      "- Allergy tests. Your provider may suggest allergy testing to see if you may be allergic to certain foods, additives, or even dental materials or mouth care products.\n",
      "- Salivary measurements. With burning mouth syndrome, your mouth may feel dry. Salivary tests can tell if you have a reduced salivary flow.\n",

Sensors placed on your body record and monitor brain waves, the oxygen level in your blood, heart rate and breathing during sleep. The sensors also record eye and leg movements while you sleep. You may be videotaped to document your behavior during sleep cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment usually isn't needed for sleep terrors that happen rarely. Children typically outgrow sleep terrors.\n",
      "Treatment may be needed if the sleep terrors cause a safety risk, interfere with sleep, don't go away with time or happen more often. Being embarrassed or disrupting the sleep of others may lead some people to seek treatment.\n",

      "- Eye refraction. This test uses special equipment that measures your eyes. You may be asked to look through a device that contains wheels of different lenses, called a phoropter. This device helps judge which combination gives you the sharpest vision. Some doctors may use a hand-held instrument called a retinoscope to evaluate the eyes.\n",

      "- Keratometry. This exam involves focusing a circle of light on the cornea and measures the reflection. This determines the basic shape of the cornea.\n",
      "- Computerized corneal mapping. Special photographic tests, such as corneal tomography and corneal topography, record images to create a detailed shape map of the cornea. Corneal tomography also can measure the thickness of the cornea. This type of testing can often detect early signs of keratoconus before the disease is visible by slit-lamp examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for keratoconus depends on the severity of your condition and how quickly the condition is progressing. Generally, there are two approaches to treating keratoconus: slowing the progression of the disease and improving vision.\n",
      "If keratoconus is progressing, corneal collagen cross-linking may be indicated to slow it or stop it from getting worse. This treatment aims to stabilize the structure of the cornea. It may decrease the bulging of the cornea and help achieve better vision with glasses or contact lenses. This treatment also has the potential to prevent you from needing a cornea transplant in the future.\n",
      "Improving vision depends on the severity of keratoconus. Mild to moderate keratoconus can be treated with eyeglasses or contact lenses. This will likely be a long-term treatment, especially if the cornea becomes stable with time or from cross-linking.\n",
      "In some people with keratoconus, the cornea becomes scarred with advanced disease. For others, wearing contact lenses becomes difficult. In these people, cornea transplant surgery might be necessary.\n",

      "During the exam, the healthcare professional carefully inspects the outer genitals. The health professional inserts two fingers of one hand into the vagina. At the same time, that person's other hand presses on the belly to feel the uterus and ovaries. A device called a speculum is inserted into the vagina. The device opens the vaginal canal so the health professional can look for changes in the vagina and cervix. Changes could be signs of cancer or other problems.\n",
      "- Inspecting the vagina with a magnifying instrument. Colposcopy is an exam to look at the vagina with a special lighted magnifying instrument. Colposcopy helps to magnify the surface of the vagina to look for any changes that might be cancerous.\n",
      "- Removing a sample of vaginal tissue for testing. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue to test for cancer cells. Often, a biopsy is done during a pelvic exam or a colposcopy exam. The tissue sample is sent to a lab for testing.\n",

      "- Blood tests. A blood test will let your doctor know if you have elevated levels of muscle enzymes, which can indicate muscle damage. A blood test can also detect specific autoantibodies associated with different symptoms of polymyositis, which can help in determining the best medication and treatment.\n",
      "- Electromyography. This test involves inserting a thin needle electrode through the skin into the muscle. Electrical activity is measured as you relax or tighten the muscle, and changes in the pattern of electrical activity can confirm a muscle disease. The doctor can determine the distribution of the disease by testing different muscles.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A scanner creates cross-sectional images of your muscles from data generated by a powerful magnetic field and radio waves. Unlike a muscle biopsy, an MRI can assess inflammation over a large area of muscle.\n",
      "- Muscle biopsy. During this test, a small piece of muscle tissue is surgically removed for laboratory analysis. Analysis may reveal abnormalities, such as inflammation, damage, certain proteins or enzyme deficiencies.\n",

      "A skin test can help find out if someone's skin reacts to the latex protein. A medical professional uses a tiny needle to place a small amount of latex below the surface of the skin on the forearm or back. If someone is allergic to latex, a raised bump will form. Only an allergist or other healthcare professional experienced in skin testing should perform this test.\n",

If you have an anaphylactic reaction, you will need to go to the emergency room for an immediate injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.\n",
      "For less severe reactions, a care professional may prescribe antihistamines or corticosteroids. These may be taken after exposure to latex to control the reaction and help relieve discomfort.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "To diagnose your condition, your healthcare professional checks your symptoms and does a physical exam. To know how serious your brachial plexus injury is, you may need one or more of the following tests:\n",
      "- X-ray. An X-ray of the shoulder and neck can show fractures or other related injuries.\n",
      "- Electromyography (EMG). During an EMG, a healthcare professional places a needle electrode through the skin into different muscles. The test looks at the electrical activity of the muscles when they tighten and when they're at rest. You may feel a little pain when the electrodes are put in, but most people can finish the test without much discomfort.\n",
      "- Nerve conduction studies. These tests are usually done as part of EMG. They measure how fast and how well electrical signals travel down the nerves. This provides information about how well the nerve is working.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to make very detailed images of the organs and tissues in the body. It can show how much damage there is to the brachial plexus after an injury. It also can show any artery damage in the limb, which is important for reconstruction. New types of high-resolution MRI, such as magnetic resonance neurography or diffusion tensor imaging, may be used.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) myelography. Computerized tomography uses a series of X-rays to create images of the body. CT myelography uses contrast dye, injected during a spinal tap, to look for issues in the spinal cord and nerve roots. This test is sometimes done when MRIs don't give enough information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment depends on many factors, such as the seriousness of the injury, the type of injury, the length of time since the injury and other existing conditions.\n",
      "Nerves that have only been stretched may heal on their own.\n",
      "Your healthcare team may suggest physical therapy to keep the joints and muscles working properly, maintain range of motion, and prevent stiff joints.\n",
      "Surgery is often the best option for serious nerve injuries. In the past, surgery was sometimes delayed to see if the nerves would heal on their own. However, new research shows that delaying surgery by more than 2 to 6 months could make the repair less successful. New imaging techniques can help your healthcare team decide when surgery would be most beneficial.\n",
      "Nerve tissue grows slowly, so it can take many years before you see the final results of surgery. During recovery, you can do exercises to keep your joints flexible. Splints may be used to keep the hand from curling inward.\n",

      "Diagnosing vasovagal syncope often begins with a physical examination. During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and take your blood pressure. He or she may also massage the main arteries in your neck to see if that causes you to feel faint.\n",
      "Your doctor may also recommend several tests to rule out other possible causes of your fainting — particularly heart-related problems. These tests may include:\n",
      "- Electrocardiogram. This test records the electrical signals your heart produces. It can detect irregular heart rhythms and other cardiac problems. You may need to wear a portable monitor for at least a day or as long as a month.\n",
      "- Echocardiogram. This test uses ultrasound imaging to view the heart and look for conditions, such as valve problems, that can cause fainting.\n",
      "- Exercise stress test. This test studies heart rhythms during exercise. It's usually conducted while you walk or jog on a treadmill.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Your doctor may look for conditions, such as anemia, that can cause or contribute to fainting spells.\n",
      "- Tilt table test. If no heart problems appear to cause your fainting, your doctor may suggest that you undergo a tilt table test. During the test, you lie flat on your back on a table that changes positions, tilting you upward at various angles. A technician monitors your heart rhythms and blood pressure during the test to see if changing your posture affects them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "In most cases of vasovagal syncope, treatment is unnecessary. Your doctor may help you identify your fainting triggers and discuss ways you might avoid them.\n",
      "However, if you experience vasovagal syncope often enough to interfere with your quality of life, your doctor may suggest trying one or more of the following remedies:\n",
      "- Medications. A drug called fludrocortisone acetate that's normally used to treat low blood pressure may be helpful in preventing vasovagal syncope. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors also may be used.\n",
      "- Therapies. Your doctor may recommend ways to decrease the pooling of blood in your legs. These may include foot exercises, wearing compression stockings or tensing your leg muscles when standing. You may need to increase salt in your diet if you don't usually have high blood pressure. Avoid prolonged standing — especially in hot, crowded places — and drink plenty of fluids.\n",
      "- Surgery. Very rarely, inserting an electrical pacemaker to regulate the heartbeat may help some people with vasovagal syncope who haven't been helped by other treatments.\n",

      "- Keep the joint from moving. Activity can cause a ganglion cyst to grow. So wearing a brace or splint to keep the joint still for a time might help. As the cyst shrinks, it may release the pressure on nerves, relieving pain. But long-term use of a brace or splint can weaken nearby muscles.\n",

      "During the physical exam, your healthcare professional checks the outside of your vagina, anus and the area between the two, called the perineum. Your healthcare professional looks for symptoms such as scarring, irregular vaginal discharge, leaking urine or stool, and pockets of pus called abscesses.\n",
      "A pelvic exam also may be done to check the health of your outer vagina and your reproductive organs. During the exam, your healthcare professional inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers into your vagina with one hand. At the same time, the other hand presses gently on the outside of your lower stomach. A device called a speculum may be used to spread open the walls of your vagina and see inside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for a vaginal fistula depends on factors such as the type of fistula you have, its size and whether the tissue that surrounds it is healthy.\n",
      "For a simple vaginal fistula or one with few symptoms, some procedures may help the fistula to heal on its own. A simple vaginal fistula may be one that's small or one that's not linked with cancer or radiation therapy. Procedures to help a simple vaginal fistula heal include:\n",
      "- Placement of urinary catheter. A catheter is a medical device that sometimes can treat small fistulas between the vagina and bladder. A urinary catheter is a flexible tube that drains the bladder. You might need to use it for more than three weeks.\n",
      "- Ureteral stenting. This procedure can treat some fistulas between the vagina and the ureters. A hollow tube called a stent is placed inside the ureter to keep it open.\n",
      "For a simple fistula between the vagina and rectum, you may need to change your diet too. Your healthcare professional also may recommend supplements to make stool softer and easier to pass.\n",
      "Most often, surgery is needed to treat a vaginal fistula. Before surgery can be done, any infection or swelling in tissue around the vaginal fistula needs to be treated. If tissue is infected, medicines called antibiotics can clear up the infection. If the tissue is inflamed due to a condition such as Crohn's disease, medicines such as biologics are used to control the swelling.\n",
      "Surgery for a vaginal fistula aims to remove the fistula tract and stitch together healthy tissue to close the opening. Sometimes, a flap made of healthy tissue is used to help close the area. Surgery may be done through the vagina or stomach area. Often, a type of surgery that involves one or more small cuts can be done. This is called laparoscopic surgery. Some surgeons also control robotic arms with an attached camera and surgical tools.\n",
      "Some people with fistulas between the vagina and the rectum need surgery to fix damage to a ring of nearby muscle called the anal sphincter. When the anal sphincter is healthy, it keeps the anus closed as stool collects in the rectum.\n",
      "Less often, people with fistulas between the vagina and the rectum need a procedure called a colostomy before surgery. With a colostomy, an opening is made in the stomach area through which stool can leave the body and collect in a bag. This helps the fistula heal. The procedure usually is temporary. The colostomy opening is closed a few months after fistula surgery. Rarely, the colostomy is permanent.\n",
      "Surgery to repair a vaginal fistula often is successful, especially if you haven't had the fistula for a long time. Still, some people need more than one surgery to get relief.\n",

      "- Open fracture. In this type of fracture, the skin is pierced by the broken bone. This is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment to decrease the chance of an infection.\n",
      "- Closed fracture. In closed fractures, the surrounding skin remains intact.\n",
      "- Incomplete fracture. This term means that the bone is cracked but not separated into two parts.\n",
      "- Complete fracture. In complete fractures, the bone has broken into two or more parts.\n",
      "- Displaced fracture. In this type of fracture, the bone fragments on each side of the break are not aligned. A displaced fracture may require surgery to realign the bones properly.\n",
      "- Greenstick fracture. In this type of fracture, the bone cracks but doesn't break all the way through — like when you try to break a green stick of wood. Greenstick fractures are more likely to occur in children because a child's bones are softer and more flexible than those of an adult.\n",

A healthcare professional reviews your child's symptoms and health history and does a physical exam. Your child's healthcare professional likely will look at your child's head, neck, nose, mouth and tongue.\n",
      "Other tests might be needed as well. The main test to check for sleep apnea in children is called a polysomnogram. This involves an overnight sleep test. Sensors are placed on your child's body. The sensors record brain waves, breathing patterns, snoring, oxygen levels, heart rate and muscle activity while your child sleeps. This test may take place at a sleep center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Your child's healthcare professional works with you to find the right treatment for your child's pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. Most often, the first treatment for the condition is surgery to remove enlarged tonsils and adenoids. This is called adenotonsillectomy (ad-uh-no-ton-sil-EK-tuh-me). But some children get better with medicines or medical devices.\n",
      "The right treatment plan for your child depends on your child's sleep apnea symptoms and risk factors. For most children, treatment includes adenotonsillectomy, but your child's healthcare professional may recommend other treatments if this surgery isn't right for your child. Other treatments also may be needed if the surgery doesn't fully treat your child's obstructive sleep apnea.\n",
      "Some kids get better without sleep apnea treatments. It's possible for some children with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea to outgrow the condition. A healthcare professional may recommend closely watching a child for up to six months to see if the symptoms get better. This is called watchful waiting. If the child also has allergies or other conditions that irritate the airway, watchful waiting can include treatment for those.\n",

      "To diagnose an anal fistula, your health care provider will discuss your symptoms and do a physical exam. The exam includes looking at the area around and inside your anus.\n",
      "The external opening of an anal fistula is usually easily seen on the skin around the anus. Finding the fistula's internal opening inside the anal canal is more complicated. Knowing the complete path of an anal fistula is important for effective treatment.\n",
      "One or more of the following imaging tests may be used to identify the fistula tunnel:\n",
      "- MRI can map the fistula tunnel and provide detailed images of the sphincter muscle and other structures of the pelvic floor.\n",
      "- Endoscopic ultrasound, which uses high-frequency sound waves, can identify the fistula, the sphincter muscles and surrounding tissues.\n",
      "- Fistulography is an X-ray of the fistula that uses an injected contrast to identify the anal fistula tunnel.\n",
      "- Examination under anesthesia. A colon and rectal surgeon may recommend anesthesia during an examination of the fistula. This allows for a thorough look at the fistula tunnel and can identify any possible complications.\n",
      "Other options to identify the fistula's internal opening include:\n",
      "- Fistula probe. An instrument specially designed to be inserted through a fistula is used to identify the fistula tunnel.\n",
      "- Anoscope. A small endoscope is used to view the anal canal.\n",
      "- Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. These procedures use an endoscope to examine the large intestine (colon). Sigmoidoscopy can evaluate the lower part of the colon (sigmoid colon). Colonoscopy, which examines the full length of the colon, is important to look for other disorders, especially if ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is suspected.\n",
      "- An injected dye solution. This may help locate the fistula opening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment of an anal fistula depends on the fistula's location and complexity and its cause. The goals are to repair the anal fistula completely to prevent recurrence and to protect the sphincter muscles. Damage to these muscles can lead to fecal incontinence. Although surgery is usually required, sometimes nonsurgical treatments may be an option.\n",
      "Surgical options include:\n",
      "- Fistulotomy. The surgeon cuts the fistula's internal opening, scrapes and flushes out the infected tissue, and then flattens the tunnel and stitches it in place. To treat a more complicated fistula, the surgeon may need to remove some of the tunnel. Fistulotomy may be done in two stages if a significant amount of sphincter muscle must be cut or if the entire tunnel can't be found.\n",
      "- Endorectal advancement flap. The surgeon creates a flap from the rectal wall before removing the fistula's internal opening. The flap is then used to cover the repair. This procedure can reduce the amount of sphincter muscle that is cut.\n",
      "- Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT). LIFT is a two-stage treatment for more-complex or deep fistulas. LIFT allows the surgeon to access the fistula between the sphincter muscles and avoid cutting them. A silk or latex string (seton) is first placed into the fistula tunnel, forcing it to widen over time. Several weeks later, the surgeon removes infected tissue and closes the internal fistula opening.\n",
      "Nonsurgical options include:\n",
      "- Seton placement. The surgeon places a seton into the fistula to help drain the infection. This allows the tunnel to heal. This procedure may be combined with surgery.\n",
      "- Fibrin glue and collagen plug. The surgeon clears the tunnel and stitches shut the internal opening. Special glue made from a fibrous protein (fibrin) is then injected through the fistula's external opening. The anal fistula tunnel also can be sealed with a plug of collagen protein and then closed.\n",
      "- Medication. Medication may be part of treatment if Crohn's disease is the cause of an anal fistula.\n",
      "In cases of complex anal fistula, more-invasive surgical procedures may be recommended, including:\n",
      "- Ostomy and stoma. The surgeon creates a temporary opening in the abdomen to divert the intestines away from the anal canal. Waste is collected into a bag on the abdomen. This procedure allows the anal area time to heal.\n",
      "- Muscle flap. In very complex anal fistulas, the tunnel may be filled with healthy muscle tissue from the thigh, labia or buttock.\n",

For children, the team might include teachers, who look at learning and attention issues. For children and adults, the team might include mental health professionals, called psychologists, who look at how the mind works. And speech-language pathologists can look at the use of language.\n",
      "A hearing specialist called an audiologist may do tests to see what is happening when you or your child hear sounds. These tests might include:\n",
      "- Tympanometry. This test can tell if the eardrum isn't moving well. The eardrum needs to move for good hearing. For this test, the audiologist places a soft probe in the ear canal. Then they send small bits of air pressure toward the ear. The probe measures how much the eardrum moves in response to the air.\n",
      "- Acoustic reflex test. This test shows what happens in the ear when it hears a loud sound.\n",
      "- Auditory brainstem response. This test shows how well the inner ear, called the cochlea, and the brain pathways for hearing are working. An audiologist places sensors around the ear and on the head. The sensors connect to a computer.\n",
      "Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test. The computer records how the nerves between the ears and the brain respond to the sounds.\n",
      "- Evoked potential test. This test shows how well sound travels along the nerves that connect the ears to the brain. For this test, an audiologist places sensors on the head. The sensors connect to a computer. Short clicking sounds come through headphones worn during the test.\n",
      "This lets an audiologist see how well sound gets to different parts of the brain. It also shows if anything is blocking the nerves that link the ears to the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",

      "- Hearing aids and listening devices. Your health care team may suggest that you use hearing aids with wireless listening devices. Listening devices help direct sound to you. They get sound from the source to your hearing aid.\n",
      "Frequency modulated, or FM, systems send sounds to you so you can hear them better. They work with a hearing aid and direct sounds to it. These systems help make it easier to hear sounds in noisy environments.\n",
      "- Auditory training. Auditory training, also called hearing rehabilitation, helps you adjust to hearing loss. You may train with an audiologist, a speech-language pathologist or both. You may train one-on-one with a therapist or as part of a group.\n",
      "During auditory training, you learn to tell one type of sound from another. You do this by listening to sounds that are louder and softer, given quickly and slowly. Sounds come from different directions. You also learn to tell the difference between speech sounds, which affects the meaning of the words you hear.\n",
      "Auditory training helps the brain tell the difference between the many sounds you hear every day. The goal is to help you feel like you're able to talk with others more.\n",
      "- Computer-based training. Computer-based programs can help train the brain to recognize and understand sounds. These programs are like auditory training, but you do them online or with a computer program.\n",

Your healthcare team may ask you to do these specific actions during an episode of a fast heartbeat. These actions affect the vagus nerve, which helps control the heartbeat.\n",
      "- Medicines. If vagal maneuvers don't stop a fast heartbeat, you might need medicines to control the heart rate and restore the heart rhythm. Medicines may need to be given by IV.\n",
      "- Cardioversion. Paddles or patches on the chest are used to electrically shock the heart and help reset the heart rhythm. Cardioversion is typically used when vagal maneuvers and medicines don't work. It's also possible to do cardioversion with medicines.\n",
      "- Catheter ablation. In this procedure, a doctor inserts one or more thin, flexible tubes called catheters into an artery, usually in the groin. The doctor guides them to the heart. Sensors on the tip of the catheters use heat or cold energy to create tiny scars in the heart. The scars block irregular electrical signals and restore the heart's rhythm.

Or the tube can be passed through your rectum to look at your large intestine (colonoscopy). Sometimes a pill-sized camera that you swallow is used to create pictures of your intestines (capsule endoscopy). Other tests might include imaging tests, such as X-rays, a  CT scan or an  MRI scan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Radiation enteritis treatment usually involves managing symptoms until they go away. This condition causes irritation of the intestines after radiation therapy for cancer. Your health care provider might recommend changes to your diet and medications for diarrhea and pain. Antibiotics can treat an overgrowth of bacteria. If radiation enteritis lasts longer, you might need a feeding tube. Sometimes, surgery is used to bypass the part of the intestine that's irritated.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Tests to evaluate your condition may include:\n",
      "- Clinical breast exam. Your doctor feels (palpates) your breasts and the lymph nodes located in your lower neck and underarm area checking for unusual breast tissue. If the breast exam — along with your medical history — suggests you have normal breast changes, you may not need additional tests.\n",
      "But if your doctor finds a new lump or suspicious breast tissue, you may need to come back a few weeks later, after your period, for another clinical breast exam. If the changes persist or the breast exam is concerning, you may need additional tests, such as a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound.\n",
      "- Mammogram. If your doctor detects a breast lump or prominent thickening in your breast tissue, you need a diagnostic mammogram — an X-ray exam that focuses on a specific area of concern in your breast. The radiologist closely examines the area of concern when interpreting the mammogram.\n",
      "- Ultrasound. An ultrasound uses sound waves to produce images of your breasts and is often performed along with a mammogram. If you're younger than age 30, you might have an ultrasound instead of a mammogram. Ultrasound is better for evaluating a younger woman's dense breast tissue — tissue tightly packed with lobules, ducts and connective tissue (stroma). Ultrasound can also help your doctor distinguish between fluid-filled cysts and solid masses.\n",
      "- Fine-needle aspiration. For a breast lump that feels a lot like a cyst, your doctor may try fine-needle aspiration to see if fluid can be withdrawn from the lump. This helpful procedure can be done in the office. A fine-needle aspiration may collapse the cyst and resolve discomfort.\n",
      "- Breast biopsy. If a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound are normal, but your doctor still has concerns about a breast lump, you may be referred to a breast surgeon to determine whether you need a surgical breast biopsy.\n",
      "A breast biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of breast tissue for microscopic analysis. If a suspicious area is detected during an imaging exam, your radiologist may recommend an ultrasound-guided breast biopsy or a sterotactic biopsy, which uses mammography to pinpoint the exact location for the biopsy.\n",
      "It's important to report any new or persistent breast changes to your doctor, even if you've had a normal mammogram within the last year. You may need a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound to evaluate the changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "If you don't experience symptoms, or your symptoms are mild, no treatment is needed for fibrocystic breasts. Severe pain or large, painful cysts associated with fibrocystic breasts may warrant treatment.\n",
      "Treatment options for breast cysts include:\n",
      "- Fine-needle aspiration. Your doctor uses a hair-thin needle to drain the fluid from the cyst. Removing fluid confirms that the lump is a breast cyst and, in effect, collapses it, relieving associated discomfort.\n",
      "- Surgical excision. Rarely, surgery may be needed to remove a persistent cyst-like lump that doesn't resolve after repeated aspiration and careful monitoring or has features that concern your doctor during a clinical exam.\n",
      "Examples of treatment options for breast pain include:\n",
      "- Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or prescription medication\n",
      "- Oral contraceptives, which lower the levels of cycle-related hormones linked to fibrocystic breast changes\n",

This can help guide fertility treatment options for you and your partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatments for low sperm count include:\n",
      "- Surgery. For example, a varicocele can often be fixed with surgery. Or an obstructed vas deferens can be repaired. Past vasectomies can be reversed. If no sperm are present in the semen, sperm often can be collected directly from the testicles or epididymis.\n",
      "- Treatments for infections. Antibiotics can cure an infection of the reproductive tract caused by germs. But this doesn't always restore fertility. And it's rare for genital tract infections to be linked with infertility.\n",
      "- Treatments for sexual conditions. Medicine or counseling can help improve fertility in conditions such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.\n",
      "- Hormone treatments and medications. These treatments can help if you have infertility caused by high or low levels of certain hormones. These treatments also may help if you have issues with the way your body uses hormones.\n",
      "- Assisted reproductive technology (ART). Some couples have trouble becoming pregnant despite frequent sex. ART refers to treatments that can help couples become pregnant without sex. ART treatments involve collecting sperm through ejaculation or surgery or from donors. The way sperm is collected depends on your situation and wishes. Various types of ART are available. The sperm can be placed in the uterus through a tube, a process called intrauterine insemination. Or the sperm and eggs can be mixed together in a lab and placed in the uterus, a process called in vitro fertilization. Or a single healthy sperm can be injected into each mature egg before placement in the uterus. This is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection.\n",

      "Allergy testing is the only sure way to tell what's causing your symptoms, so your provider may recommend one or both of these tests:\n",
      "- Skin prick test. Small amounts of the proteins found in shellfish are pricked into skin on your arm or upper back. You're then watched for an allergic reaction. If you're allergic, you'll develop a raised bump (hive) at the test site on your skin. This typically takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Allergy specialists usually are best equipped to perform allergy skin tests.\n",
      "- Blood test. A blood sample is sent to a lab to measure your immune system's response to a specific allergen. This test measures your immune system's response to shellfish proteins by measuring the amount of allergy-causing antibodies in your bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.\n",

If you're at risk of anaphylaxis to shellfish, your health care provider can give you a prescription in advance and explain how and when to give the injection. Regularly check the expiration date on the packaging to make sure it's current.\n",
      "Carry injectable epinephrine (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others) with you at all times. Epinephrine is typically given at the first sign of an allergic reaction. A second dose may be needed if symptoms recur. After you use epinephrine, seek emergency medical care, even if you start to feel better.\n",

      "- Blood tests. A blood sample can check for signs of infections, blood sugar levels or electrolyte imbalances.\n",
      "- Lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. You may need to have a sample of cerebrospinal fluid removed for testing if an infection might have caused the seizure.\n",
      "- Electroencephalogram (EEG). In this test, flat metal discs called electrodes attached to your scalp record the electrical activity of your brain. This shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may reveal a pattern that tells whether a seizure is likely to occur again. EEG testing also may help exclude other conditions that could cause a seizure.\n",

The scale uses short questions to measure your degree of sleepiness. You'll answer how likely it is that you would fall asleep in certain times, such as sitting down after lunch.\n",
      "- Your sleep records. You may be asked to write down your sleep pattern for a week or two. This allows your healthcare professional to compare how your sleep pattern may relate to how alert you feel. You might wear a device on your wrist, known as an actigraph. It measures periods of activity and rest, along with how and when you sleep.\n",
      "- A sleep study, known as polysomnography. This test measures signals during sleep using flat metal discs called electrodes placed on your scalp. For this test, you must spend a night at a medical facility. The test measures your brain waves, heart rate and breathing. It also records your leg and eye movements.\n",
      "- Multiple sleep latency test. This test measures how long it takes you to fall asleep during the day. You'll be asked to take four or five naps at a sleep center. Each nap needs to be two hours apart. Specialists will observe your sleep patterns. People who have narcolepsy fall asleep easily and enter into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep quickly.\n",

      "Fractures are classified into one or more of the following categories:\n",
      "- Open (compound) fracture. The broken bone pierces the skin, a serious condition that requires immediate, aggressive treatment to decrease the risk of infection.\n",
      "- Closed fracture. The skin remains unbroken.\n",
      "- Displaced fracture. The bone fragments on each side of the break aren't aligned. Surgery might be required to realign the fragments.\n",
      "- Comminuted fracture. The bone is broken into pieces, so it might require surgery.\n",
      "- Greenstick fracture. The bone cracks but doesn't break all the way — like what happens when you bend a green stick of wood. Most broken bones in children are greenstick fractures because children's bones are softer and more flexible than are those of adults.\n",
      "- Buckle (torus) fracture. One side of the bone is compressed, which causes the other side to bend (buckle). This type of fracture is also more common in children.\n",

      "- No desire to have any type of sexual activity or to masturbate.\n",
      "- Few or no sexual thoughts or fantasies.\n",
      "- Not wanting to make the first move in a sexual encounter with a partner.\n",

      "To diagnose an arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, your healthcare professional reviews your symptoms and gives you a physical exam.\n",
      "Your healthcare professional may listen for a sound called a bruit. A bruit is a whooshing sound caused by blood quickly flowing through arteries and veins of an AVM. It sounds like water rushing through a narrow pipe. A bruit can interfere with your hearing or sleep or cause emotional distress.\n",
      "Tests commonly used to help diagnose AVM include:\n",
      "- Cerebral angiography. This test looks for an AVM in the brain. Also called arteriography, this test uses a special dye called a contrast agent injected into an artery. The dye highlights the blood vessels to better show them on X-rays.\n",
      "- CT scan. These scans can help show bleeding. CT scans use X-rays to create images of the head, brain or spinal cord.\n",
      "- CT angiography. This test combines a CT scan with an injection of a dye to help find an AVM that is bleeding.\n",
      "- MRI. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to show detailed images of tissues. An MRI can pick up on small changes in these tissues.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance angiography, also known as an MRA. MRA captures the pattern and the speed and distance of blood flow through the irregular vessels.\n",
      "- Transcranial doppler ultrasound. This test can help diagnose an AVM and tell whether the AVM is bleeding. The test uses high-frequency sound waves aimed at arteries to create an image of blood flow and its speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment of an arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, depends on where it is found, your symptoms and the risks of treatment. Sometimes an AVM is monitored with regular imaging tests to watch for changes. Other AVMs require treatment. Your healthcare professional may recommend conservative management if the AVM hasn't burst and you are not at high risk of the AVM bleeding.\n",
      "When deciding whether to treat an arteriovenous malformation, healthcare professionals consider:\n",
      "- Whether the AVM has bled.\n",
      "- Whether the AVM is causing symptoms other than bleeding.\n",
      "- Whether the AVM is in a part of the brain where it can safely be treated.\n",
      "- Other characteristics of the AVM, such as its size.\n",

If your medical history and the breast and physical exam reveal nothing unusual, you may not need additional tests.\n",
      "- Mammogram. If your doctor feels a breast lump or unusual thickening, or detects a focused area of pain in your breast tissue, you'll need an X-ray exam of your breast that evaluates the area of concern found during the breast exam (diagnostic mammogram).\n",
      "- Ultrasound. An ultrasound exam uses sound waves to produce images of your breasts, and it's often done along with a mammogram. You might need an ultrasound to evaluate a focused area of pain even if the mammogram appears normal.\n",
      "- Breast biopsy. Suspicious breast lumps, areas of thickening or unusual areas seen during imaging exams may require a biopsy before your doctor can make a diagnosis. During a biopsy, your doctor obtains a small sample of breast tissue from the area in question and sends it for lab analysis.\n",
      "\n",

      "For many people, breast pain resolves on its own over time. You may not need any treatment.\n",
      "If you do need help managing your pain or if you need treatment, your doctor might recommend that you:\n",
      "- Eliminate an underlying cause or aggravating factor. This may involve a simple adjustment, such as wearing a bra with extra support.\n",
      "- Use a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication. You may need to use NSAIDs when your pain is intense. Your doctor may recommend that you apply an NSAID cream directly to the area where you feel pain.\n",
      "- Adjust birth control pills. If you take birth control pills, skipping the pill-free week or switching birth control methods may help breast pain symptoms. But don't try this without your doctor's advice.\n",
      "- Reduce the dose of menopausal hormone therapy. You might consider lowering the dose of menopausal hormone therapy or stopping it entirely.\n",
      "- Take a prescription medication. Danazol is the only prescription medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating fibrocystic breasts. However, danazol carries the risk of potentially severe side effects, such as heart and liver problems, as well as weight gain and voice changes. Tamoxifen, a prescription medication for breast cancer treatment and prevention, may help, but this drug also carries the potential for side effects that may be more bothersome than the breast pain itself.\n",

      "- Antifungal gels, creams, lotions, foams or shampoos alternated with another medication. Your health care provider might suggest you try a product with 2% ketoconazole or 1% ciclopirox (Loprox). Or you might rotate between two or more products. Ketoconzole can worsen the dryness of tightly coiled or chemically treated hair and increase the risk of breakage. To ease this effect, use it only once a week with a moisturizing conditioner.\n",
      "How often you shampoo or apply other antifungal products will depend on your hair-grooming practices and symptoms. Medicated shampoos can be used once a day or 2 to 3 times a week for several weeks. Let the product sit on your scalp for a few minutes — see package directions — so it has time to work. Then rinse. After your symptoms clear up, use a medicated shampoo just once a week or once every two weeks. This will help prevent a relapse.\n",
      "- Creams, lotions, shampoos or ointments that control inflammation. Your health care provider might prescribe a prescription-strength corticosteroid you apply to the scalp or other affected area. These include hydrocortisone, fluocinolone (Capex, Synalar), clobetasol (Clobex, Temovate) and desonide (Desowen, Desonate). They are effective and easy to use. And use them only until symptoms clear up. If used for many weeks or months without a break, they can cause side effects. These include loss of skin color, thinning skin, and skin showing streaks or lines.\n",
      "Creams or ointments with a calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus (Protopic) or pimecrolimus (Elidel) may be effective. Another benefit is that they have fewer side effects than corticosteroids do. But they are not first-choice treatments because the Food and Drug Administration has concerns about a possible association with cancer. In addition, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus cost more than mild corticosteroid medications.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Frontal lobe epilepsy can be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms can be mistaken for mental health problems or sleep disorders such as night terrors. It also is possible that some symptoms of frontal lobe seizures are the result of seizures that begin in other parts of the brain.\n",
      "To make a diagnosis, a health care professional reviews your symptoms and medical history. The care professional also conducts a physical exam. You may have blood drawn to test for health conditions or disorders that may be causing the seizures.\n",
      "You might need a neurological exam, which will test your:\n",
      "- Muscle strength.\n",
      "- Sensory skills.\n",
      "- Hearing and speech.\n",
      "- Vision.\n",
      "- Coordination and balance.\n",
      "You also might need the following tests:\n",
      "- Brain scans. Brain imaging — usually an MRI — might reveal the source of frontal lobe seizures. An MRI uses radio waves and a powerful magnetic field to produce detailed images of soft tissues, which make up the brain.\n",
      "An MRI involves lying on a narrow table that slides into a long tube. The test often takes about an hour. Some people have a fear of enclosed spaces. They can be given a medicine to feel sleepy and less anxious. The test itself is painless.\n",
      "- Electroencephalogram, known as an EEG. An EEG monitors the electrical activity in the brain. This is done by attaching small metal discs called electrodes to the scalp. EEGs often help diagnose some types of epilepsy. However, EEG results might not identify frontal lobe epilepsy.\n",
      "- Video EEG. Video EEG is recommended for some people with seizures. This test is usually performed during an overnight stay at a sleep clinic. Both a video camera and an EEG monitor run all night. A video EEG allows health care professionals to match what physically occurs during a seizure with what appears on the EEG.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Over the past decade, treatment options have increased for frontal lobe seizures. There are newer types of anti-seizure medicines. There also are a variety of surgical procedures that might help if medicines don't work.\n",

      "- Self-care measures. Self-care measures might provide relief from symptoms or help prevent the prolapse from getting worse. Self-care measures include performing exercises to strengthen pelvic muscles. These are called Kegel exercises. You might also benefit from losing weight and treating constipation.\n",

      "- Urine test. Lab tests of a sample of urine might find an infection caused by a virus or bacteria. A urine test also might detect the presence of blood or pus in the urine.\n",
      "- Blood test. Lab tests of a blood sample might find a bacterial or viral infection. Or they might detect higher levels of certain proteins that are linked with testicular cancer.\n",

      "In the past, surgery might have included removing an arm or leg, known as amputation. But medical advances have made amputation less likely.\n",
      "To lower the chances of the cancer returning, radiation therapy or chemotherapy might be used as well.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy treats cancer with powerful energy beams. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a machine moves around you. The machine directs radiation to precise points on the body.\n",
      "Radiation before surgery can shrink the cancer and make a successful surgery more likely. Radiation therapy after surgery can kill cancer cells that might still be there.\n",
      "- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy treats cancer with strong medicines. For synovial sarcoma, chemotherapy might be used before or after surgery. It also may be used when cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n",
      "- Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses medicines that attack specific chemicals in the cancer cells. This can cause cancer cells to die or stop growing. Targeted therapy medicines are being studied for advanced synovial sarcoma.\n",
      "- Cell therapy. Cell therapy helps the immune system find and stop the cancer cells. This treatment involves taking some of your immune system cells and making them better at recognizing the cancer cells. Then the cells are put back in your body. This treatment can take months to set up. One cell therapy used for synovial sarcoma is afamitresgene autoleucel (Tecelra). It might be an option for treating advanced synovial sarcoma that hasn't been helped by chemotherapy.\n",

      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses powerful magnets and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the brain. These can identify a characteristic striped pattern (tigroid) of abnormal white matter (leukodystrophy) in the brain.\n",
      "- Psychological and cognitive tests. Your doctor may assess psychological and thinking (cognitive) abilities and assess behavior. These tests may help determine how the condition affects brain function. Psychiatric and behavioral problems may be the first signs in juvenile and adult forms of metachromatic leukodystrophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Metachromatic leukodystrophy can't be cured yet, but clinical trials hold some promise for future treatment. Current treatment is aimed at preventing nerve damage, slowing progression of the disorder, preventing complications and providing supportive care. Early recognition and intervention may improve outcomes for some people with the disorder.\n",
      "As the disorder progresses, the level of care required to meet daily needs increases. Your health care team will work with you to help manage signs and symptoms and try to improve quality of life. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of participating in a clinical trial.\n",
      "Metachromatic leukodystrophy can be managed with several treatment approaches:\n",
      "- Medications. Medications may reduce signs and symptoms, such as behavioral problems, seizures, difficulty with sleeping, gastrointestinal issues, infection and pain.\n",
      "- Physical, occupational and speech therapy. Physical therapy to promote muscle and joint flexibility and maintain range of motion may be helpful. Occupational and speech therapy can help maintain functioning.\n",
      "- Nutritional assistance. Working with a nutrition specialist (dietitian) can help provide proper nutrition. Eventually, it may become difficult to swallow food or liquid. This may require assistive feeding devices as the condition progresses.\n",
      "- Other treatments. Other treatments may be needed as the condition progresses. Examples include a wheelchair, walker or other assistive devices; mechanical ventilation to assist with breathing; treatments to prevent or address complications; and long-term care or hospitalization.\n",
      "Care for metachromatic leukodystrophy can be complex and change over time. Regular follow-up appointments with a team of medical professionals experienced in managing this disorder may help prevent certain complications and link you with appropriate support at home, school or work.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Diagnosis of a breast lump involves getting an exam and possibly tests to find out the cause of the lump. During the physical exam, your healthcare professional checks your breasts, chest wall, underarms and neck. You're checked while you're sitting upright and again while lying on your back.\n",
      "You'll likely need one or more imaging tests to check for changes in the breasts. These include:\n",
      "- Diagnostic mammogram. This is an X-ray of your breasts. During a mammogram, your breasts are compressed between two firm surfaces. Then an X-ray takes black-and-white images. When your healthcare professional orders a diagnostic mammogram, this tells the radiologist who reviews your images that you have a new breast concern. A diagnostic mammogram is different from a screening mammogram, which looks for breast cancer before a person has symptoms.\n",
      "- Focused or directed ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to make images of the inside of your breasts. The sound waves come from a wand-like instrument called a transducer that is moved over your breasts. Your healthcare professional tells the radiologist about the area of concern on the breast.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI). This exam is done less often than mammogram and ultrasound. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to see inside your breasts. During an MRI, you lie in a large, tube-shaped machine that scans your body and makes images. Sometimes, the breast MRI may be done even if the diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound look regular. For example, MRI may be used if your breasts are very dense, and your healthcare professional has concerns about the clinical exam of your breasts.\n",
      "If these tests show that your lump is not cancer, you might need follow-up appointments. That way, your healthcare professional can check to see if the lump grows, changes or goes away.\n",
      "If imaging tests don't help diagnose the lump, your healthcare professional might take a sample of cells for lab testing. This is called a biopsy. There are various types of biopsies. Your healthcare professional recommends the one that is right for you. Breast biopsies include:\n",
      "- Fine-needle aspiration. A small amount of breast tissue or fluid is removed with a thin needle. This procedure can be used to check a complex cyst or to drain fluid from a painful cyst.\n",
      "- Core needle biopsy. A healthcare professional called a radiologist may do this procedure. A radiologist finds and treats health problems using medical imaging tests. With core needle biopsy, ultrasound is used to guide a needle into the breast lump and take a sample to check. Often, a tiny clip that you can't see or feel also is placed into the biopsied area. It serves as a marker that lets healthcare professionals find the area again during future checkups.\n",
      "- Stereotactic biopsy. For this procedure, you lie face down on a padded table. One of your breasts is placed in a hole in the table. Breast X-rays provide a 3D view of the breast to help guide a needle to the lump to collect a tissue sample. You may need this procedure if a suspicious area shows up on a mammogram, but the area can't be found with ultrasound. A tiny clip often is placed at the time of the biopsy and serves as a marker for future appointments.\n",
      "- Surgical biopsy. This procedure removes the entire breast lump. It's also called a lumpectomy or wide local excision. You receive medicine to keep you from feeling pain. You also may be given medicine that makes you sleep during the procedure.\n",
      "Whichever type of biopsy you have, your healthcare professional sends the tissue samples to a lab to be checked by a pathologist. That's a doctor who studies diseases and the changes they cause in body tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for a breast lump depends on its cause. Your healthcare professional helps you choose the treatment that's right for you. Causes of breast lumps and their treatment options include:\n",
      "- Fibrocystic breasts. If you have fibrocystic breasts, your healthcare professional may suggest pain medicines that you can buy without a prescription. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine. Or you may need prescription hormone therapy, such as birth control pills.\n",
      "- Breast cysts. Some breast cysts go away without any treatment. If the cyst is painful, you may need fine-needle aspiration. This procedure drains the fluid out of the cyst with a needle. This can ease the pain.\n",
      "If you have painful breast cysts that last a while and keep coming back, your healthcare professional may suggest surgery to remove the painful breast tissue. But most often, painful, recurring breast cysts go away around the time of menopause. That's when hormone changes happen less often.\n",
      "- Fibroadenomas. A fibroadenoma might go away without treatment after a few months. You'll have regular ultrasound exams of your breast tissue to check the size of the fibroadenoma and how it looks. Ultrasound exams also can check whether the lump stays the same size or grows. If it grows or looks unusual during an ultrasound, you may need a biopsy. Depending on lab findings, your healthcare professional may suggest surgery to remove the fibroadenoma.\n",
      "- Infections. Medicines called antibiotics cure most breast infections caused by germs called bacteria. But you may need a procedure known as an incision and drainage if a pocket of pus called an abscess forms and does not get better with antibiotics.\n",
      "- Lipoma. Most often, a lipoma in the breast doesn't need to be treated. But if a lipoma causes painful symptoms, it can be removed with surgery or a procedure called liposuction that removes fat cells.\n",
      "- Intraductal papilloma. These may not need treatment. But sometimes, intraductal papillomas and the part of the duct they are in are removed with surgery.\n",
      "- Breast cancer. Treatment for breast cancer depends on the type of cancer and whether it has spread. Your healthcare professional may suggest treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy such as anti-estrogen medicines or radiation therapy. Or you might be able to join a clinical trial that tests new treatments.\n",

      "Your healthcare provider will likely start by asking about your medical history and doing a physical exam that includes listening to your chest with a stethoscope.\n",
      "To determine if you have pleurisy and identify the cause, your healthcare provider might recommend:\n",
      "- Blood tests. A blood test might tell if you have an infection. Other blood tests might detect an autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. In these conditions, pleurisy can be the first sign.\n",
      "- Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show if your lungs are fully inflating or if there is air or fluid between the lungs and ribs.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan combines a series of X-ray images taken from different angles around your body. It uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images that look like slices of your chest. These detailed images can show the condition of the pleura. They can also show if there are other causes of pain, such as a blood clot in the lung.\n",
      "- Ultrasound. This imaging method uses high-frequency sound waves to produce precise images of structures within your body. An ultrasound might be used to determine whether you have a pleural effusion.\n",
      "- Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This heart-monitoring test might be recommended to rule out certain heart problems as a cause for your chest pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for pleurisy focuses primarily on the underlying cause. For example, if bacterial pneumonia is the cause, an antibiotic can be prescribed to manage the infection. If the cause is a viral infection, pleurisy may go away on its own.\n",
      "The pain and inflammation associated with pleurisy is usually treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). Occasionally, your healthcare provider may prescribe steroid medication.\n",
      "The outcome of pleurisy treatment depends on the seriousness of the underlying cause. Early diagnosis and treatment of the condition that caused pleurisy can help you feel better. Depending on the cause and the condition, you may make a full recovery.\n",

      "To evaluate your child's condition, a speech-language pathologist reviews your child's symptoms and medical history. The speech-language pathologist also conducts an exam of the muscles used for speech, and looks at how your child produces speech sounds, words and phrases.\n",
      "Your child's speech-language pathologist also may assess your child's language skills, including vocabulary, sentence structure and ability to understand speech.\n",
      "Diagnosis of CAS isn't based on a single test or observation. A diagnosis is made based on the pattern of problems that are seen. The specific tests conducted during the evaluation depend on your child's age, ability to cooperate and the severity of the speech problem.\n",
      "It can sometimes be hard to diagnose CAS, especially when a child speaks very little or has trouble interacting with the speech-language pathologist.\n",
      "Still, it's important to identify whether your child shows symptoms of CAS because CAS is treated differently from other speech disorders. Your child's speech-language pathologist may be able to determine the best treatment approach for your child even if the diagnosis is not certain at first.\n",
      "Tests may include:\n",
      "- Hearing tests. Your doctor may order hearing tests to determine if hearing problems could be contributing to your child's speech problems.\n",
      "- Oral-motor assessment. Your child's speech-language pathologist will examine your child's lips, tongue, jaw and palate for structural problems, such as tongue-tie or a cleft palate. The speech-language pathologist also will look for other problems such as low muscle tone. Low muscle tone usually isn't associated with CAS, but it may be a sign of other conditions.\n",
      "Your child's speech-language pathologist will watch how your child moves his or her lips, tongue and jaw in activities such as blowing, smiling and kissing.\n",
      "- Speech evaluation. Your child's ability to make sounds, words and sentences may be observed during play or other activities.\n",
      "Your child may be asked to name pictures. This allows the speech-language pathologist to check to see if your child has trouble making specific sounds or speaking certain words or syllables.\n",
      "Your child's speech-language pathologist also may evaluate your child's coordination and smoothness of movement in speech. Your child may be asked to repeat syllables such as \"pa-ta-ka\" or say words such as \"buttercup.\"\n",
      "If your child can speak sentences, the speech-language pathologist observes your child's melody and rhythm of speech. Melody and rhythm are heard in the way your child puts stress on syllables and words.\n",
      "Your child's speech-language pathologist may help your child by providing cues, such as saying the word or sound more slowly or providing touch cues to the face.\n",
      "A trial of speech therapy to observe how your child responds to CAS treatment can help the speech-language pathologist confirm CAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Children don't outgrow childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), but speech therapy can help them make the most progress. Speech-language pathologists may treat CAS with many therapies.\n",

      "- Ultrasound. An ultrasound of the area behind your abdominal organs (retroperitoneal ultrasound) allows your provider to view the kidneys and ureters.\n",
      "- Bladder catheterization. To test for incomplete or blocked urine flow, your provider inserts a small tube (catheter) through the urethra, injects dye into your bladder, and takes X-rays of your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra before and during urination.\n",
      "- Renal nuclear scan. Your provider or a technician injects a tracer that contains a small amount of radioactive material into your arm. A special camera detects the radioactivity and produces images that your provider uses to evaluate the urinary system.\n",
      "- Cystoscopy. A small tube with a camera and light is inserted into your urethra or through a small incision. The optical system allows the provider to see inside the urethra and bladder.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan combines a series of X-ray views taken from many different angles and computer processing to create cross-sectional images of your kidneys, ureter and bladder.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Severe pain following tooth removal is often enough for your dentist or oral surgeon to suspect dry socket. You'll likely be asked if you have any other symptoms. Your dentist or oral surgeon can check your mouth to see if you have a blood clot in your tooth socket or if you have lost the clot and have exposed bone.\n",
      "You may need X-rays of your mouth and teeth to rule out other conditions, such as a bone infection. The X-rays also can show if you have small pieces of tooth root or bone remaining in the site after surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment of dry socket focuses on reducing symptoms, especially pain. Treatment may include:\n",
      "- Flushing out the socket. Your dentist or oral surgeon may flush out the socket to remove any food bits or other loose materials that may add to pain or possible infection.\n",
      "- Dressing with medicine. Your dentist or oral surgeon may pack the socket with medicated gel or paste and a dressing. These can provide quick pain relief. Whether you need dressing changes and how often and whether you need other treatment depends on how severe your pain and other symptoms are.\n",
      "- Pain medicine. Ask which pain medicine is best for you. You'll likely need a prescription pain medicine.\n",
      "- Self-care. Once your dentist or oral surgeon takes out the dressing, you may need to flush the socket at home to keep it clean and improve healing. Your dentist or oral surgeon can give you instructions. You may get a plastic syringe with a curved tip to squirt water, salt water or a prescription rinse into the socket.\n",
      "Once treatment starts, you may begin to feel some pain relief. Pain and other symptoms should continue to improve and will likely be gone within a few days. Even when you're feeling better, keep scheduled appointments with your dentist or oral surgeon for dressing changes and other care.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Your doctor usually can tell whether you have a keloid by looking at the affected skin. You might need a skin biopsy to rule out skin cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Keloid scar treatments include the following. One or a combination of approaches might be best for your situation. Even after successful flattening or removal, keloids can grow back, sometimes bigger than before. Or you may develop new ones.\n",
      "- Wound care. For newer keloids, the first treatment option might be compression dressings made from stretchy fabric or other materials. This method is also used after surgery to remove keloids. The goal is to reduce or prevent a scar by putting pressure on the wound as it heals. Such dressings need to be worn for 12 to 24 hours a day for 4 to 6 months to be effective. This method can be very uncomfortable.\n",
      "- Corticosteroid cream. Applying a prescription strength corticosteroid cream can help ease itchiness.\n",
      "- Injected medicine. If you have a smaller keloid, your doctor might try reducing its thickness by injecting it with cortisone or other steroids. You'll likely need monthly injections for up to six months before seeing the scar flatten. Possible side effects of corticosteroid injections are skin thinning, spider veins and a permanent change in skin color (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation).\n",
      "- Freezing the scar. Small keloids might be reduced or removed by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy). Repeat treatments might be needed. Possible side effects of cryotherapy are blistering, pain and loss of skin color (hypopigmentation).\n",
      "- Laser treatment. Larger keloids can be flattened by pulsed-dye laser sessions. This method has also been useful in easing itchiness and causing keloids to fade. Pulsed-dye laser therapy is delivered over several sessions with 4 to 8 weeks between sessions. Your doctor might recommend combining laser therapy with cortisone injections. Possible side effects, which are more common in people with darker skin, include hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, blistering and crusting.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Low-level X-ray radiation alone or after surgical removal of a keloid can help shrink or minimize the scar tissue. Repeat treatments might be needed. Possible side effects of radiation therapy are skin complications and, in the long term, cancer.\n",
      "- Surgical removal. If your keloid hasn't responded to other therapies, your doctor might recommend removing it with surgery in combination with other methods. Surgery alone has a recurrence rate of 45% to 100%.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "Pituitary tumors often aren't noticed or aren't detected. In many cases, that's because the symptoms caused by pituitary tumors that make hormones, called functioning adenomas, and large tumors, called macroadenomas, are similar to those of other medical conditions. It's also because they grow very slowly over time. Small pituitary tumors that don't make hormones, called nonfunctioning microadenomas, often don't cause symptoms. If they are detected, it's typically because of an imaging exam, such as an MRI or a CT scan, that's done for another reason.\n",
      "To detect and diagnose a pituitary tumor, your health care provider will likely talk with you about your personal and family medical history and do a physical exam. Testing to detect a pituitary tumor also may include:\n",
      "- Blood tests. Blood tests can show whether your body has too much or too little of certain hormones. For some hormones, blood test results that show too much of the hormone may be all that's needed for your health care provider to diagnose a pituitary adenoma.\n",
      "For other hormones, such as cortisol, a blood test result that shows too much of the hormone may need to be followed by other tests. Those tests can show if the earlier result was caused by a pituitary adenoma or by another health concern.\n",
      "Results that show hormone levels are too low need to be followed with other tests, usually imaging exams, to see if a pituitary adenoma may be the cause of those test results.\n",
      "- Urine tests. A urine test may be used to help diagnose a pituitary adenoma that's making too much of the hormone ACTH. Too much ACTH leads to too much cortisol in the body and causes Cushing disease.\n",
      "- MRI scan. A magnetic resonance imaging scan, also called an MRI scan, is a test that uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the body's organs and tissues. An MRI of the brain can help detect a pituitary tumor and show its location and size.\n",
      "- CT scan. A computed tomography scan, also called a CT scan, is a type of imaging test that combines a series of X-rays to create cross-sectional images. MRI scans are used more often than CT scans to detect and diagnose pituitary tumors. But a CT scan may be helpful in planning surgery if your health care provider tells you that a pituitary tumor must be removed.\n",
      "- Vision testing. A pituitary tumor can affect eyesight, especially side vision, also called peripheral vision. Testing your eyes to check how well you can see may help your health care provider decide if other tests may be needed to detect a pituitary tumor.\n",
      "Your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in hormone disorders, called an endocrinologist, for more testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Many pituitary adenomas don't need treatment. They are not cancer, so if they don't cause symptoms, simply watching them over time may be a good approach. If treatment is needed, the specific treatment depends on the tumor type, size, location and growth over time. If a tumor is causing too much or too little of certain hormones in the body, that also affects the treatment. Your age and overall health play a role in treatment planning too.\n",
      "The goal of treatment is to:\n",
      "- Return hormone levels to a healthy range.\n",
      "- Avoid more damage to the pituitary gland and restore its regular function.\n",
      "- Reverse symptoms caused by tumor pressure or prevent them from getting worse.\n",
      "If a pituitary adenoma needs treatment, it may include surgery to remove the tumor. Medication or radiation therapy also might be used to treat a pituitary adenoma. Treatment involves a team of medical experts. The team may include a:\n",

If hip dysplasia is suspected, a hip ultrasound might be ordered to check the hip joint for signs of dysplasia.\n",
      "Mild cases of hip dysplasia can be difficult to diagnose and might not start causing problems until you're a young adult. If your healthcare team suspects hip dysplasia, they might suggest imaging tests, such as X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Hip dysplasia treatment depends on the age of the affected person and the extent of the hip damage. Infants are usually treated with a soft brace, such as a Pavlik harness, that holds the ball portion of the joint firmly in its socket for several months. This helps the socket mold to the shape of the ball.\n",
      "The brace doesn't work as well for babies older than 6 months. Instead, the healthcare professional may move the bones into the proper position and then hold them there for several months with a full-body cast. Sometimes surgery is needed to fit the joint together properly.\n",
      "If the dysplasia is more serious, the position of the hip socket also can be corrected. In a periacetabular (per-e-as-uh-TAB-yoo-lur) osteotomy, the socket is repositioned in the pelvis so that it matches up better with the ball.\n",

      "- Other medicines. Some medicines, including anticonvulsant drugs, can relieve hemifacial spasm in some people.\n",
      "- Surgery. There are several types of surgery that can help relieve hemifacial spasm. One type of surgery, called decompression, involves making an opening in the skull and opening the covering of the brain, called the dura. This exposes the facial nerve where it leaves the brainstem.\n",
      "A surgeon then finds the blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve. Putting a spongelike material between the nerve and blood vessel eases pressure on the nerve. This surgery often works to relieve hemifacial spasm.\n",

      "- Filling out a questionnaire. You may fill out a form that helps your provider assess your medical history, the degree of your prolapse and how much it affects your quality of life. This information also helps guide treatment decisions.\n",
      "- Bladder and urine tests. If you have significant prolapse, you might be tested to see how well and completely your bladder empties. Your provider might also run a test on a urine sample to look for signs of a bladder infection, if it seems that you're retaining more urine in your bladder than is normal after urinating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment depends on whether you have symptoms, how severe your anterior prolapse is and whether you have any related conditions, such as urinary incontinence or more than one type of pelvic organ prolapse.\n",
      "Mild cases — those with few or no obvious symptoms — typically don't require treatment. Your provider may recommend a wait-and-see approach, with occasional visits to monitor your prolapse.\n",
      "If you do have symptoms of anterior prolapse, first line treatment options include:\n",
      "- Pelvic floor muscle exercises. These exercises — often called Kegel exercises or Kegels — help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, so they can better support your bladder and other pelvic organs. Your provider or a physical therapist can give you instructions for how to do these exercises and can help you determine whether you're doing them correctly.\n",
      "- A supportive device (pessary). A vaginal pessary is a plastic or rubber ring inserted into your vagina to support the bladder. A pessary does not fix or cure the actual prolapse, but the extra support the device provides can help relieve symptoms. Your doctor or other care provider fits you for the device and shows you how to clean and reinsert it on your own. Many women use pessaries as a temporary alternative to surgery, and some use them when surgery is too risky.\n",

      "A child who's been forcefully shaken will need to be examined by many different medical specialists, as well as an expert in child abuse.\n",
      "The doctor will examine the child and ask questions about the child's medical history. Various tests may be needed to detect injuries, including:\n",
      "- Skeletal survey. Several X-rays of the bones — possibly including the arms, hands, legs, feet, spine, ribs and skull — may be used to determine whether fractures are accidental or purposeful. Such testing can also help find previous fractures.\n",
      "- Eye exam. An eye exam can reveal bleeding in the eye and other eye injuries.\n",
      "- Blood tests. Some metabolic and genetic disorders, as well as bleeding and clotting disorders, can cause symptoms similar to shaken baby syndrome. Blood tests can help rule out some of these conditions.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of a child's brain and spine. It can show brain bruising, bleeding and signs of decreased oxygen. Because an MRI is difficult to perform on a child who's unstable, it's usually done two to three days after the injury.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-ray images to provide cross-sectional images of the body. A CT scan of the brain can help detect injuries that need urgent treatment. A CT scan of the abdomen may also be done to determine if there are additional injuries.\n",
      "Depending on the extent of the injuries, the baby may need to be monitored in a pediatric intensive care unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Emergency treatment for a child who has been shaken may include breathing support and surgery to stop bleeding in the brain. Some children may require medications to reduce brain swelling and prevent seizures.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "To diagnose esophageal spasms, a healthcare professional may recommend:\n",
      "- Upper endoscopy. An upper endoscopy uses a tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube to visually examine the upper digestive system. Endoscopy also can be used to collect a sample of tissue to be tested for other esophageal diseases. This tissue sample is known as a biopsy.\n",
      "- X-rays of the upper digestive system, also called an esophagram. X-rays are taken after drinking a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of the digestive tract. The coating allows a specialist to see a silhouette of the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine. Some people may experience loose stools for 1 to 2 days after this test.\n",
      "- Esophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in the esophagus when swallowing; the coordination and force exerted by the esophagus muscles; and how well the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes or opens during a swallow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment depends on how often the esophageal spasms happen and how bad they are.\n",
      "If the spasms only happen now and then, a healthcare professional might first recommend avoiding extremely hot or cold foods to see if that relieves symptoms.\n",
      "If your spasms make it difficult to eat or drink, your provider might recommend:\n",
      "- Managing any underlying conditions. Esophageal spasms are sometimes associated with conditions such as heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A healthcare professional might recommend a proton pump inhibitor to treat GERD. Sometimes an antidepressant, such as imipramine, may be prescribed. This medicine may help reduce the feeling of pain in the esophagus.\n",
      "- Medicines to relax your swallowing muscles. Peppermint oil, onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections into the esophagus or calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others), can make spasms less severe.\n",
      "- Surgery (myotomy). If medicine doesn't work, a healthcare professional might recommend a procedure that involves cutting the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus. This procedure, called a myotomy, can help weaken esophageal contractions. Long-term studies of this approach aren't available, so myotomy generally isn't recommended for esophageal spasms. However, it might be considered if other treatments don't work.\n",
      "- Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). The POEM procedure is minimally invasive. This newer technique involves placing an endoscope through the mouth and down the throat. This allows a surgeon to make a cut in the inside lining of the esophagus. Then, as in standard myotomy, the surgeon cuts the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus. Like standard myotomy, POEM is usually considered only if other treatments don't work.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "To diagnose median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, a healthcare professional examines you and asks questions about your symptoms. The healthcare professional may hear a whooshing sound, called a bruit, when listening to your stomach with a stethoscope. The sound may occur when a blood vessel is narrowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Surgery is the only treatment for median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS. Surgery for MALS can improve or reduce symptoms in most people.\n",
      "The most common surgical treatment is median arcuate ligament release, also called decompression. It's usually done as an open surgery through a cut in the belly area. Sometimes it is done using a camera and small instruments passed through several smaller openings. This is called laparoscopic surgery.\n",
      "During decompression surgery, the surgeon cuts away parts of the median arcuate ligament. This reduces pressure on the celiac artery and nerves. The surgeon removes the nerves around the celiac artery and its branches. Bundles of nerves on each side of the celiac artery also may be removed.\n",
      "Some people with MALS also may need surgery to repair or replace a blocked celiac artery and restore blood flow.\n",
      "If you have MALS release surgery, you usually stay in the hospital for 2 to 3 days. You may have an ultrasound or a CT scan about a month after surgery to make sure that blood flow is fully restored. You may need to see a nutritionist to help with returning to a healthy diet.

Or they might measure the fluid in the four quadrants of the uterus, also called the amniotic fluid index (AFI). Polyhydramnios is diagnosed if the MVP is 8 or greater, or the AFI is 24 or greater.\n",

      "- Blood tests. These can check for infectious diseases linked with polyhydramnios.\n",
      "- Amniocentesis. This is a procedure in which a sample of amniotic fluid is removed from the uterus for testing. The fluid contains fetal cells and various chemicals produced by the baby. The cells in the fluid also can be used for genetic testing if there is concern for a genetic disorder.\n",
      "Your health care team closely tracks your pregnancy if you have polyhydramnios. You may receive the following exams:\n",
      "- Nonstress test. This test checks how your baby's heart rate reacts when your baby moves. During the test, you'll wear a special device on your stomach, also called the abdomen, to measure the baby's heart rate. A buzzer-like device also may be used to wake the baby and encourage movement.\n",
      "- Biophysical profile. This test uses an ultrasound to provide more information about your baby's breathing, tone and movement. It also can help measure the volume of amniotic fluid in the uterus. It may be combined with a nonstress test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Mild polyhydramnios rarely needs treatment. It may go away on its own.\n",
      "Otherwise, treatment for an underlying cause — such as diabetes — may help clear up polyhydramnios.\n",
      "You may need treatment in the hospital if you have severe polyhydramnios with symptoms such as shortness of breath, stomach pain or contractions. Polyhydramnios treatment may include:\n",
      "- Drainage of extra amniotic fluid. Your health care team may use amniocentesis to drain the extra amniotic fluid from your uterus. This procedure carries a small risk of health problems. These include preterm labor, placental abruption and premature rupture of the membranes.\n",
      "- Medicine. Your health care professional may prescribe medicine taken by mouth called indomethacin (Indocin). It's used for 48 hours to help decrease contractions and reduce amniotic fluid volume. Ask your care team to talk with you about the possible side effects.\n",
      "After treatment, your health care team likely will want to check your amniotic fluid level about every 1 to 3 weeks.\n",
      "If you have mild to moderate polyhydramnios, your care team probably will plan to have you deliver your baby at 39 or 40 weeks. If you have severe polyhydramnios, your team likely will talk about the right timing of delivery. The goal is to lower the chances of health problems for you and your baby.\n",

      "- Surgery to remove the tumor. Ameloblastoma treatment usually includes surgery to remove the tumor. Ameloblastoma often grows into the nearby jawbone, so surgeons may need to remove the affected part of the jawbone. An aggressive approach to surgery reduces the risk that ameloblastoma will come back.\n",
      "- Surgery to repair the jaw. If surgery involves removing part of your jawbone, surgeons can repair and reconstruct the jaw. This can help improve how your jaw looks and works afterward. The surgery can also help you to be able to eat and speak.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy using high-powered energy beams might be needed after surgery or if surgery isn't an option.\n",
      "- Prosthetics. Specialists called prosthodontists can make artificial replacements for missing teeth or other damaged natural structures in the mouth.\n",
      "- Supportive care. A variety of specialists can help you work through speaking, swallowing and eating problems during and after treatment. These specialists may include dietitians, speech and language therapists, and physical therapists.\n",

      "Sometimes a growth plate fracture cannot be seen on X-ray. If the child is tender over the area of the growth plate, your doctor may recommend a cast or a splint to protect the limb. X-rays are taken again in three to four weeks and, if there was a fracture, new bone healing will typically be seen at that time.\n",
      "For more-serious injuries, scans that can visualize soft tissue — such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT) or ultrasound — may be ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment for growth plate fractures depends on the severity of the fracture. The least serious fractures usually require only a cast or a splint. If the fracture crosses the growth plate or goes into the joint and is not well-aligned, surgery may be necessary. Growth plates that are surgically realigned may have a better chance of recovering and growing again than do growth plates that are left in a poor position.\n",
      "At the time of injury, it's difficult to tell if a growth plate has permanent damage. Your doctor may recommend checking X-rays for several years after the fracture to make sure the growth plate is growing appropriately. Depending on the location and severity of the fracture, your child may need follow-up visits until his or her bones have finished growing.\n",

      "If you have cirrhosis, your health care provider typically screens you for esophageal varices when you're diagnosed. How often you'll have screening tests depends on your condition. Main tests used to diagnose esophageal varices are:\n",
      "- Endoscopic exam. A procedure called upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the preferred method of screening for esophageal varices. An endoscopy involves inserting a flexible, lighted tube called an endoscope down the throat and into the esophagus. A tiny camera on the end of the endoscope lets your doctor examine your esophagus, stomach and the beginning of your small intestine, called the duodenum.\n",
      "The provider looks for dilated veins. If found, the enlarged veins are measured and checked for red streaks and red spots, which usually indicate a significant risk of bleeding. Treatment can be performed during the exam.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. Both abdominal CT scans and Doppler ultrasounds of the splenic and portal veins can suggest the presence of esophageal varices. An ultrasound test called transient elastography may be used to measure scarring in the liver. This can help your provider determine if you have portal hypertension, which may lead to esophageal varices.\n",

      "- Ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the inside of your body. To capture the images, a device called a transducer is pressed against the outside of your lower belly. Or you may have the transducer put into your vagina. This is called transvaginal ultrasound. You may need both types of ultrasound to get the best view. A 3D ultrasound may be used, if it's available at your facility.\n",
      "- Sonohysterogram. The sonohysterogram (son-o-HIS-ter-o-gram) is a special type of ultrasound scan. You have fluid injected through a tube into your uterus. The fluid outlines the shape of your uterus on the ultrasound scan. This allows your doctor to look for anything unusual.\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI machine looks like a tunnel that has both ends open. You lie down on a movable table that slides into the opening of the tunnel. This painless test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the inside of your body.\n",
      "- Hysterosalpingography. During a hysterosalpingography (his-tur-o-sal-ping-GOG-ruh-fe), a special dye is injected into your uterus through your cervix. As the dye moves through your reproductive organs, X-rays are taken. These images show the shape and size of your uterus. They also show if your fallopian tubes are open.\n",
      "Sometimes, ultrasound or MRI is also done to check for kidney problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Treatment often isn't needed for a double uterus if you have no symptoms or other problems. Surgery to join a double uterus isn't usually done.\n",
      "But sometimes surgery can help. If the uterus is partially divided, and you've had a pregnancy loss with no other medical explanation for the loss, your doctor might recommend surgery. This may help you keep a future pregnancy.\n",
      "Surgery also might help if you have a double vagina along with a double uterus. The procedure removes the wall of tissue separating the two vaginas. This can make childbirth a little easier.\n",

      "- Pelvic floor strength tests. A healthcare professional tests the strength of the pelvic floor and sphincter muscles during a pelvic exam. This tests the strength of the muscles and ligaments that support the vaginal walls, uterus, rectum, urethra and bladder.\n",
      "- Bladder function tests. Some tests show whether the bladder leaks when it's held in place during the pelvic exam. Other tests might measure how well the bladder empties.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "The tests and procedures you might undergo to diagnose a neuroendocrine tumor will depend on where your tumor is located in your body. In general, tests might include:\n",
      "- Physical exam. Your doctor may examine your body to better understand your signs and symptoms. He or she may feel for swollen lymph nodes or look for signs that a tumor is producing excess hormones.\n",
      "- Tests to look for excess hormones. Your doctor may recommend testing your blood or your urine for signs of excess hormones that are sometimes produced by neuroendocrine tumors.\n",
      "- Imaging tests. You might undergo imaging tests, such as ultrasound, CT and MRI, to create pictures of your tumor. For neuroendocrine tumors, pictures are sometimes created using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer that's injected into a vein.\n",
      "- Procedures to remove a sample of cells for testing (biopsy). To collect the cells, the doctor might insert a long, thin tube with a light and a camera on the end into your lungs (bronchoscopy), your esophagus (endoscopy) or your rectum (colonoscopy), depending on your situation. Sometimes, collecting a tissue sample requires surgery.\n",
      "If there's a risk that your neuroendocrine tumor may have spread to other parts of your body, you might have additional tests to determine the extent of the cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "The treatment options for your neuroendocrine tumor will depend on the type of tumor, its location, and whether you're experiencing signs and symptoms of excess hormones produced by the tumor.\n",
      "In general, neuroendocrine tumor treatment options might include:\n",
      "- Surgery. Surgery is used to remove the tumor. When possible, surgeons work to remove the entire tumor and some of the healthy tissue that surrounds it. If the tumor can't be removed completely, it might help to remove as much of it as possible.\n",
      "- Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses strong drugs to kill tumor cells. It can be given through a vein in your arm or taken as a pill. Chemotherapy might be recommended if there's a risk that your neuroendocrine tumor might recur after surgery. It might also be used for advanced tumors that can't be removed with surgery.\n",
      "- Targeted drug therapy. Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities present within tumor cells. By blocking these abnormalities, targeted drug treatments can cause tumor cells to die. Targeted drug therapy is usually combined with chemotherapy for advanced neuroendocrine tumors.\n",
      "- Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). PRRT combines a drug that targets cancer cells with a small amount of a radioactive substance. It allows radiation to be delivered directly to the cancer cells. One PRRT drug, lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (Lutathera), is used to treat advanced neuroendocrine tumors.\n",
      "- Medications to control excess hormones. If your neuroendocrine tumor releases excess hormones, your doctor might recommend medications to control your signs and symptoms.\n",
      "- Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill tumor cells. Some types of neuroendocrine tumors may respond to radiation therapy. It might be recommended if surgery isn't an option.\n",
      "Other treatments might be available to you depending on your particular situation and your specific type of neuroendocrine tumor.\n",

      "To confirm a diagnosis of small bowel prolapse, your doctor performs a pelvic exam. During the exam, your doctor may ask you to take a deep breath and hold it while bearing down like you're having a bowel movement (Valsalva maneuver), which is likely to cause the prolapsed small bowel to bulge downward. If your doctor can't verify that you have a prolapse while you're lying on the exam table, he or she may repeat the exam while you're standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "Small bowel prolapse typically doesn't need treatment if the symptoms don't trouble you. Surgery may be effective if you have advanced prolapse with bothersome symptoms. Nonsurgical approaches are available if you wish to avoid surgery, if surgery would be too risky or if you want to become pregnant in the future.\n",
      "Treatment options for small bowel prolapse include:\n",
      "- Observation. If your prolapse causes few or no obvious symptoms, you don't need treatment. Simple self-care measures, such as performing exercises called Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles, may provide symptom relief. Avoiding heavy lifting and constipation may reduce the likelihood of worsening your prolapse.\n",
      "- Pessary. A silicone, plastic or rubber device inserted into your vagina supports the bulging tissue. Pessaries come in a variety of styles and sizes. Finding the right one involves some trial and error. Your doctor measures and fits you for the device, and you learn how to insert, remove and clean it.\n",
      "- Surgery. A surgeon can perform surgery to repair the prolapse through the vagina or abdomen, with or without robotic assistance. During the procedure, your surgeon moves the prolapsed small bowel back into place and tightens the connective tissue of your pelvic floor. Sometimes, small portions of synthetic mesh may be used to help support weakened tissues.\n",
      "A small bowel prolapse usually doesn't recur. However, further injury to the pelvic floor can happen with increased pelvic pressure, for instance with constipation, coughing, obesity or heavy lifting.\n",

      "- Neurological exam. Your healthcare professional may test your behavior, motor abilities and mental function. This can show how well your brain and nervous system are working.\n",
      "- Blood tests. A blood sample goes to a lab to check for signs of infection, genetic conditions, blood sugar levels and electrolyte imbalances.\n",
      "- Electroencephalogram, also called EEG. Flat metal discs called electrodes attached to your scalp record the electrical activity of your brain. This shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. The EEG may show a pattern that tells whether a seizure is likely to happen again. An EEG also can help rule out other conditions that look like epilepsy.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography, also called CT. A CT scan uses X-rays to get cross-sectional images of the brain. CT scans can show what may be causing seizures. The scans can show tumors, bleeding and cysts.\n",
      "- MRI. An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to show a detailed view of the brain. An MRI can show possible causes of seizures.\n",
      "- Positron emission tomography, also called PET. PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material. A healthcare professional puts the material into a vein. The scan shows active areas of the brain. PET scans can show where in the brain the seizure began.\n",
      "- Single-photon emission computerized tomography, also called SPECT. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive tracer. A healthcare professional puts the tracer into a vein. This makes a detailed, 3D map of the blood flow in the brain during a seizure. A form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered with magnetic resonance imaging, also called SISCOM, may give even more-detailed results.\n",

      "- Does an exam to look for swelling, varicose veins and port-wine stains\n",
      "- Visually evaluates growth of bones and soft tissues\n",
      "Several diagnostic tests can help your doctor evaluate and identify the type and severity of the condition and help determine treatment. Some tests include:\n",
      "- Duplex ultrasound scanning. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create detailed images of blood vessels and blood flow.\n",
      "- MRI and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. These procedures help differentiate between bone, fat, muscle and blood vessels and can identify malformations.\n",
      "- Scanogram. Also called scanner photography, this X-ray technique creates images of bones and helps measure their lengths.\n",
      "- CT scan or CT angiography. A CT scan creates 3D images of the body that help show blood clots in veins.\n",
      "- Contrast venography. This procedure involves injecting a dye into veins and taking X-rays that can reveal atypical veins, blockages or blood clots.\n",
      "- Coagulation studies. These tests can help evaluate how the blood clots.\n",

      "Treatment:\n",
      "Although there's no cure for KTS, your doctor can help you manage symptoms and prevent complications.\n",
      "Because KTS may affect many systems in the body, your health care team may include specialists in vascular medicine and surgery, skin diseases (dermatology), interventional radiology, orthopedic surgery, physical therapy and rehabilitation, and other areas as needed.\n",
      "You and your doctor can work together to determine which of the following treatments are most appropriate for you. Treatments may include:\n",
      "- Compression therapy. Bandages or elastic garments are wrapped around affected limbs to help prevent swelling, problems with varicose veins and skin ulcers. These bandages or elastic garments often need to be custom-fit. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices — leg or arm sleeves that automatically inflate and deflate at set intervals — may be used.\n",
      "- Skin care. Skin hygiene of the affected limb can reduce infection risk and be part of treatment for superficial bleeding.\n",
      "- Physical therapy. Massage, compression and limb movement as appropriate may help relieve lymphedema in arms or legs and swelling of the blood vessels.\n",
      "- Orthopedic devices. These may include orthopedic shoes or shoe inserts to compensate for differences in leg length.\n",
      "- Epiphysiodesis (ep-ih-fiz-e-OD-uh-sis). This is an orthopedic surgical procedure that effectively can stop length overgrowth of the lower limb.\n",
      "- Embolization. This procedure, performed through small catheters placed into the veins or arteries, blocks blood flow to certain blood vessels.\n",
      "- Laser therapy. This procedure may be used to remove or lighten port-wine stains and to treat leaking and bleeding blebs on the skin.\n",
      "- Laser or radiofrequency ablation of veins. This minimally invasive procedure is used to close off malformed veins.\n",
      "- MR-guided ablation. Blood vessels are treated with a laser or cautery under MRI guidance.\n",
      "- Sclerotherapy. A solution is injected into a vein, which creates scar tissue that helps close the vein.\n",
      "- Surgery. In some cases, surgical removal or reconstruction of affected veins, removal of excess tissue, and correction of the overgrowth of bone may be beneficial.\n",
      "- Medication. Some people have benefited from oral medications that may help to treat complex vascular and lymphatic malformations that cause symptoms. But these drugs may have significant side effects that require monitoring. Topical sirolimus may help relieve symptoms of superficial vascular malformations. Studies are ongoing to determine the effectiveness and safety of these medications in people with KTS.\n",
      "In addition, treatment may be needed for complications such as bleeding, infection, blood clots or skin ulcers. Special care may be needed during pregnancy to prevent complications.\n",

      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "To find out if you have multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), your healthcare professional starts by doing a physical exam. You also answer questions about your health history and family history. You may have a blood test and imaging tests, including the following:\n",
      "- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make images of the organs and tissues in the body.\n",
      "- Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan combines a series of X-ray images taken from different angles. A computer then makes detailed pictures of the inside of the body.\n",
      "- Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan uses a substance that releases low levels of radiation to help make images of changes taking place inside the body.\n",
      "- Nuclear medicine scans. These scans use liquid substances that give off low levels of radiation to help find tumors.\n",
      "- Endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas and other scans. An endoscopic ultrasound uses sound waves to make images of the digestive tract and other nearby organs and tissues.\n",
      "Genetic testing may help find out whether someone has a genetic change that causes MEN 1. If so, that person's children are at risk of having the same genetic change and getting MEN 1. Parents and siblings also are at risk of having the genetic change that causes MEN 1.\n",
      "If no related genetic changes are found in family members, then family members don't need more screening tests. But genetic testing cannot find all the genetic changes that can cause MEN 1. If genetic testing doesn't confirm MEN 1, but it's likely that a person has it, more testing is needed. That person, as well as family members, still needs follow-up healthcare checkups with blood tests and imaging tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment:\n",
      "With MEN 1, tumors can grow on the parathyroid glands, the pancreas and the pituitary gland. That can lead to various conditions, all of which can be treated. These conditions and treatments may include:\n",
      "- Pituitary tumors. These types of tumors may be treated with surgery or medicines. Rarely, radiation therapy is used.\n",
      "- Hyperparathyroidism. Surgery to remove most of the parathyroid glands is the typical treatment for too much parathyroid hormone.\n",
      "- Neuroendocrine tumors. These are tumors that form in specialized cells called neuroendocrine cells. With MEN 1, they're in the pancreas or small intestine. Treatment depends on the type and size of the tumor.\n",
      "- Hypoglycemic syndrome. This condition happens when tumors in the pancreas called insulinomas make too much insulin hormone. Too much insulin causes low levels of blood sugar that can be life-threatening. Treatment often involves surgery. Part of the pancreas may need to be removed too.\n",
      "- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES). ZES can result in tumors called gastrinomas that make too much stomach acid. This leads to ulcers and diarrhea. Healthcare professionals may prescribe medicine or try to remove the tumors with surgery.\n",
      "- Other pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. These tumors sometimes make other hormones that can cause health issues. Treatment of these types of tumors may involve medicine or surgery. Another treatment called ablation can be done to destroy irregular tissue that may be present.\n",
      "- Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Tumors that spread are called metastatic tumors. Sometimes with MEN 1, tumors spread to the lymph nodes or liver. They may be treated with surgery. Surgery options include liver surgery or different types of ablation.\n",
      "Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency energy that passes through a needle. The energy causes the surrounding tissue to heat up, killing the nearby cells. Cryoablation involves freezing tumors. And chemoembolization involves injecting strong chemotherapy medicines directly into the liver. When surgery is not an option, healthcare professionals may use other forms of chemotherapy or hormone-based treatments.\n",
      "- Adrenal tumors. Most of these tumors can be watched with tests over time and not treated. But if the tumors make hormones or they're large and thought to be cancerous, healthcare professionals recommend removing them. Often, the tumors can be removed with surgery that involves small incisions. This is known as minimally invasive surgery.\n",
      "- Carcinoid tumors. These slow-growing tumors in people with MEN 1 can form in the lungs, thymus gland and gastrointestinal tract. Surgeons remove these tumors when they haven't spread to other areas. Healthcare professionals may use chemotherapy, radiation therapy or hormone-based therapy for advanced carcinoid tumors.\n",
