Cramping is rarely serious and is typical of gas, passing a stool, or menstruation as the cause of your pain.Colicky Pain Like cramping, this type of pain comes and goes, but tends to be severe and to start and end suddenly. It’s typical of kidney stones or gallstones as the cause of your pain.It’s important to call your doctor if your abdominal pain is so severe that you can’t move without feeling more pain, or sit still in a comfortable position.Seek immediate medical attention if your abdominal pain is accompanied by any of the following symptoms:Fever; Bloody stool; Nausea and vomiting that doesn’t resolve; Weight loss; Yellowish skin; Abdomen very tender to touch; Swollen abdomen; \"\n",

Medications can do this by irritating the stomach, leading to nausea, pain, and diarrhea, or by slowing digestion, leading to constipation. Be sure to check the label of any drug you take to see if abdominal pain is listed as a possible side effect.Some of the most common causes of abdominal pain include the following health conditions:Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); Constipation; Peptic ulcer; Pancreatitis; Diverticulitis; Severe pain that warrants emergency medical attention may be caused by the following conditions:Aortic aneurysm rupture; Stomach or intestinal perforation; Torsion of an ovary or testicle (when the ovary or testicle twists on the tissues that support them); Other potential causes of abdominal pain include the following:Indigestion; Stomach virus; Gastritis; Menstrual cramps; Food poisoning; Foodallergies; Gas; Fecal impaction; Lactose intolerance; Pelvic inflammatory disease; Hernia; Gallstones; Kidney stones; Intestinal obstruction; Endometriosis; Crohn’s diseaseorulcerative colitis; Urinary tract infection (UTI); Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); Appendicitis; Cancer (pancreatic, stomach, or liver); Ectopic pregnancy; Celiac disease; Strained or pulled abdominal muscle; In children, common causes of abdominal pain include:Constipation; Urinary tract infection (UTI), especially in girls ages 1 to 5; Strep throat; Appendicitis; Milk allergy; Lead poisoning, often from eating paint chips; Emotional upset; \"\n",

Depending on the cause of your pain, the best course of treatment may involve self-care measures, over-the-counter or prescription medications, or procedures including drug injections or surgery.Self-Care MeasuresMild abdominal pain due to digestive upset may respond to short-term self-care measures such as the following:Avoiding solid foods for a few hours; Sipping water or clear fluids; Resting until you feel better; Avoiding dairy products, citrus fruits, fatty foods, tomato products, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages; Sticking to mild foods, like crackers, rice, bananas, or applesauce; Don’t take aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for abdominal pain, since these medications can irritate your stomach and actually increase your pain.Medication OptionsIt’s generally not advised to take any medications for abdominal pain without first talking to your healthcare provider, since some common drugs for pain can irritate your digestive tract and make your pain worse.If you have an underlying health condition that requires medical treatment, your doctor may prescribe medications such as the following:Drugs to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); Antibiotics to treat infection; Drugs to reduce inflammation; Targeted treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); Procedures and SurgeryIn rare cases, office procedures or surgery may be needed to effectively treat your abdominal pain. These procedures may include the following:Injection of a numbing agent; Corticosteroid injections; Hernia repair surgery; Appendectomy; Alternative and Complementary TherapiesIn addition to self-care measures, certain alternative therapies may help you reduce or cope with abdominal pain.

      "            \"Epidemiology\": \"Research and Statistics: How Many People Have Abdominal Pain?. Practically everyone experiences occasional abdominal pain, usually due to minor conditions like digestive upset or constipation.It’s hard to determine how many people experience chronic abdominal pain, since it can be caused by a variety of health conditions and doesn’t always come with a clear diagnosis.For example, while 5 to 7 percent of adults in the United States have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the actual prevalence of IBS is estimated to be 10 to 15 percent of the population.Constipation is believed to be even more common, affecting about 20 percent of the general population, but it may affect anywhere from 2 to 27 percent of the population, depending on the definition used. Constipation is particularly common among older adults, affecting as many as 50 percent of people who live in nursing homes. Severe constipation is most commonly seen in elderly women, according to research published in 2015.Research has linked functional gastrointestinal disorders that cause abdominal pain, like IBS and constipation, to psychological disorders. This may be explained by miscommunication between your brain and your gut, which are directly linked. People with functional GI disorders have a more acute perception of gut-related pain than other people because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. What’s more, studies have shown that psychologically based treatments have been more effective in improving digestive symptoms when compared with conventional medical treatment alone.\",\n",
      "            \"PossibleComplication\": \"Complications of Abdominal Pain. Chronic abdominal pain is associated with a number of harmful complications, including changes to your eating habits and psychological distress. People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), for example, are more likely to develop mood disorders like depression and anxiety.In addition, many of the underlying conditions that cause abdominal pain can lead to serious complications, including the possibility of structural damage to the digestive system from infection, cancer and its treatments, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).To reduce the risk of complications, it’s important to seek medical attention for your abdominal pain if it’s sudden and severe, or if it includes symptoms like fever, bloody stool, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, or visible swelling.You should also schedule a doctor visit to get your pain checked out if it lasts longer than a few days or worries you.\"\n",
